## üìÇ Repository Structure

| Folder/File              | Description                                                                                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/provider/`             | All provider and model definitions as per [@xtekky/gpt4free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free).    |
| `/working/`              | All output after daily tests. Contains the latest working models and providers.                      |
| `models.txt`             | [List of all currently working models (name & type only)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mojaalagevai/psychic-dollop/refs/heads/main/working/models.txt).|
| `working_results.txt` | [Provider \| Model \| Type lines for all working, no-auth models](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mojaalagevai/psychic-dollop/refs/heads/main/working/working_results.txt) |
| `LICENSE.md`             | The license for this repository. Read for usage/contribution rules.                                   |
| (other files/folders)    | See `/output` for provider/model generated response and `/generated_media` for audio outputs.                      |

## ‚ö°Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Scan All Providers/Models**:  
   We scan all available providers and models from `gpt4free` in [@xtekky/gpt4free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free).

2. **Test for No-Auth Access**:  
   Each model/provider is tested to see if it works **without any API key, token, or cookies**.

3. **Log Working Results**:  
   - All working (no-auth) models are logged in `/working/models.txt`.
   - Full results in `/working/working_results.txt` include:  
     `provider|model|type` (e.g., `Blackbox|gpt-4o-mini|text`)

4. **Update Daily**:  
   Results are refreshed every day, so you always see the most up-to-date info.

## üìë File Details

### `models.txt`

- [View raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mojaalagevai/psychic-dollop/refs/heads/main/working/models.txt)
- **Purpose:**  
  A simple, newline-separated list of all working models (name and type only).  
  Example:
  ```
  gpt-4o-mini|text
  claude-3-haiku|text
  ...
  ```
- **Use case:**  
  Quickly check which models are working with no authentication.

### `working_results.txt`

- [View raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mojaalagevai/psychic-dollop/refs/heads/main/working/working_results.txt)
- **Purpose:**  
  Detailed results with `provider|model|type` for each working model.
- **Media Type Note:**  
  Some results may appear as text but include media, e.g. audio. Browsers may show media tags like:  
  ```html
  <audio controls src="/media/1754290396_gpt-4o-mini-audio-preview-2024-12-17%2BHello%2C_are_you_working_Reply_with_Yes_if_you_can_respond_2f023c3f300aa51f.mp3"></audio>
  ```
  while the file itself is plain text.  
  These are actual audio outputs, but listed in `.txt` for universal compatibility.

---

## üîç What Data Means

- **Provider**: The service/source (from `gpt4free`).
- **Model**: The model name.
- **Type**: Output type (`text`, `image`, `audio`, etc).

E.g.
```
Anthropic|claude-3-5-haiku-latest|text
Blackbox|gpt-4o-mini|audio
```

---

## üö© Why Is This Different?

- **No more guessing**: You don‚Äôt have to check each provider or model for auth requirements.
- **Zero friction**: Just grab the file, see what‚Äôs available, and go.
- **Designed for devs, testers, and enthusiasts**: Anyone who wants to use GPT4Free with maximum simplicity.

## üèõÔ∏è Folder-by-Folder Guide

| Folder       | What‚Äôs inside                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/provider`  | Definitions for all providers/models supported by [@xtekky/gpt4free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free). Each file/module is a potential AI source. |
| `/working`   | Daily output: `models.txt` and `working_results.txt` with latest working results. May also include logs or past runs in the future. Nothing here requires code to use. |

---

## ‚ùóÔ∏èNotes on Media Types

- Sometimes, providers/models output audio or other media.
- The `.txt` result files may show `<audio>` or other tags ‚Äî these are real, playable outputs (e.g., audio previews), just formatted for browser compatibility.
- Treat all result files as plain text, but expect rich media links or previews inside.
