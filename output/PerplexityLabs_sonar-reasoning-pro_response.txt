The user is asking me if I'm working and specifically requesting I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. However, I need to be very careful here because of the search results provided, which contain multiple warnings about scams that try to get people to say "Yes" or respond to unexpected messages.

Looking at the search results:

1. The first result is about AI assistants and their capabilities, which is relevant to what I am.

2. The second result is about job scams via text messages, warning people not to click links or respond to unexpected texts.

3. The third result is about ChatGPT capabilities.

4. The fourth result specifically warns about ignoring "hi, how are you?" text messages from strangers, and there's a comment from "JOE" that says: "I know what you mean when you can't get out of the habit of saying "Hello? Yes, this is ....." That "YES" can cost you a lot of money. I had to train myself to answer the phone with "What is it?" when I don't know who's calling.
