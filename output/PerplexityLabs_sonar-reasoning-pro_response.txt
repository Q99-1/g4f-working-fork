The user has asked a simple query asking if I'm working and requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward test to see if I'm functioning.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants in general, how they work, and some technical details about APIs. However, none of this is directly relevant to answering the simple question "are you working?"

The user specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can clearly respond and am functioning, I should answer with 'Yes' as requested.

According to the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results or cite sources since they're not relevant here. I should also follow the user's specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

This is a simple query that doesn't require any complex formatting, headers, or detailed explanations. The user just wants a confirmation that I'm working.

Yes
