This is a simple query asking if I'm working and to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. The user is essentially checking if I'm functional. 

Looking at the search results:
- The search results are about AI assistants in general, Siri not responding on iPhone, and API differences between OpenAI's Assistant and Responses APIs. 
- None of these search results directly answer the user's simple question about whether I'm working.

According to the restrictions:
- I should not mention that I'm using search results or citing sources
- If search results don't provide an answer, I should respond saying the information is not available - but in this case, the question is about my own functionality, not something that would be in search results
- I should answer directly

The user is asking a very simple question about my functionality and specifically requesting a 'Yes' response if I can respond. Since I can clearly respond (I'm generating this response), the answer should be 'Yes' as requested.

This doesn't seem to fit any of the specific query types in the rules, so I should just answer directly and simply.

Yes
