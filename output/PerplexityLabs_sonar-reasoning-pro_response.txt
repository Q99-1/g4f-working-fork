The user is asking me to confirm if I'm working/functioning by replying with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple functional check query. The user is explicitly requesting a specific response format - just "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and their capabilities, but they're not directly relevant to answering this simple query about whether I'm working. The user just wants confirmation that I'm operational.

According to the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results or that the search results don't contain relevant information. I should just answer the query directly.

The user has given me a clear instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should simply reply with "Yes" as requested.

This falls under the rule about following user instructions taking priority over other formatting rules.

Yes
