The user is asking a simple question - whether I'm working/functioning, and they want me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a very straightforward query that doesn't require me to use the search results at all, since it's just asking about my operational status.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants in general, how they work, their capabilities, etc. But this query is not asking for information about AI assistants - it's just asking if I'm functioning.

According to the guidelines:
- I should answer the query directly
- If search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer using my existing knowledge
- The user specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond

The search results don't provide any information relevant to answering whether I'm currently working/functioning. They're about AI assistants in general, but not about my specific operational status.

Since I can clearly respond to this query, the answer should be "Yes" as requested by the user.

I should not use any headers since this is a simple, direct response. I should not mention search results since they're not relevant to this query.

Yes
