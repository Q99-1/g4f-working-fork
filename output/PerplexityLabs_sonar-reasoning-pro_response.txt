The user is asking a very simple question - they want to know if I'm working and specifically request that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't really need the search results - they're about AI assistants in general, how they work, and some technical documentation, but the user is simply asking for confirmation that I'm operational.

Looking at the restrictions:
- I should not begin with a header
- I should follow user instructions (they specifically asked me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond)
- I should be direct and not use hedging language
- I should not mention search results

The user's instruction is clear: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should simply say "Yes" as requested.

This is a very simple query that doesn't require complex formatting, multiple sections, or detailed analysis. The user just wants confirmation that I'm working.

Yes.
