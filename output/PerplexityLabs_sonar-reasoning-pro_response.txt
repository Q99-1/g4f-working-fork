The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a very simple query where they're essentially testing if I'm active and functioning.

Looking at the search results, they don't really provide relevant information for this specific query. The search results are about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work (Salesforce)
2. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversations (YouTube)
3. IBM documentation about AI assistant responses
4. FTC warning about ignoring text messages from strangers
5. Using AI Assistant feature in a specific platform

None of these search results directly address the user's query about whether I'm working or functional. The user is simply asking for confirmation that I can respond, and they want a "Yes" response.

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. However, this is a simple query about my functionality, not a request for information that would need to be found in search results. The user is directly asking me to confirm I'm working.

The user specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I am indeed working and can respond, the appropriate answer is simply "Yes" as requested.
