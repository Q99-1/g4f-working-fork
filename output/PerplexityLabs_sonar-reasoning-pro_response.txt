The user is asking me a simple question about whether I'm working and asking me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This seems like a straightforward query where they're just checking if I'm functional.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and how they work, as well as some information about responding to "how are you" messages and warnings about scam messages. However, none of this is directly relevant to the user's simple query asking if I'm working.

The user is asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond, which is exactly what I should do. This is a very simple, direct request that doesn't require extensive analysis or citing of search results.

According to the restrictions, I should not start with a header, and I should answer directly. The user is essentially testing if I'm functional, so a simple "Yes" response is appropriate here, possibly with a brief confirmation that I'm ready to help.

I should not cite any of the search results since they're not relevant to this simple functionality check query.

Yes, I'm working and ready to help you with any questions or tasks you have.
