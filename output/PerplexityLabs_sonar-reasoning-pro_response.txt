The user is asking a simple query to test if I'm working - they want me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward test query. Looking at the search results, they don't contain information relevant to this query (they're about AI assistant capabilities and Excel file recovery), so I should just respond directly based on my ability to understand and respond to the query.

The user is asking for a simple response, so I should keep it brief and direct. They specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so that's exactly what I should do.

Looking at the restrictions and guidelines:
- I should not mention search results since they're not relevant
- I should answer directly 
- The user gave specific instructions to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond
- Point 8 in the rules says "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here"

So I should simply respond with "Yes" as requested.

Yes
