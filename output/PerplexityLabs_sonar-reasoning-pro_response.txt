The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my operational status. The user has given me a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and their capabilities, but they don't directly relate to answering this specific query about whether I'm working or not.

The search results include:
1. Information about how AI assistants work and their capabilities
2. A video about how to respond to "How are you?" 
3. AI Assistant capabilities documentation
4. Information about job scam texts
5. ChatGPT capabilities overview

None of these directly answer the user's simple question about whether I'm working. Since the search results don't provide relevant information for this query, I should answer based on my existing knowledge and the user's specific instruction.

The user specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I am indeed functioning and can respond to their query, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

According to the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results, and since the search results don't contain relevant information anyway, I'll just answer the query directly as instructed.

Yes
