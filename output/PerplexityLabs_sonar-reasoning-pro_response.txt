The user is asking "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a simple query asking if I'm operational. The user is specifically requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward test of my functionality.

Looking at the search results provided:
1. Information about AI assistants and how they work
2. Information about how to respond to "How are you?" 
3. More information about AI assistants from Salesforce
4. Information about responding to interview request emails
5. Information about F5's AI assistant

None of these search results are relevant to answering the user's simple question about whether I'm working. The search results don't contain information that would help me answer this query.

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond by saying that the information is not available. However, in this case, the user is asking a direct question about my operational status, which I can answer from my own knowledge without needing search results.

The user is specifically requesting a 'Yes' response if I can respond. Since I am able to respond to their query, the appropriate answer is 'Yes'.

I should not mention that I'm using search results or that the search results don't contain relevant information, as per the restrictions. I should just answer naturally.

The query is simple and doesn't require headers, extensive formatting, or complex explanations. A simple, direct response is appropriate.

Yes
