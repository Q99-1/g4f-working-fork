This is an interesting query. The user is asking "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This seems like they're testing if I'm operational and specifically asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results provided, they seem to be about AI assistants and how they work, as well as some information about how to respond to "how are you" questions and warnings about text message scams. 

The search results don't directly address the user's query about whether I'm working or asking me to respond with 'Yes'. However, I notice that search result [4] mentions something about avoiding saying 'yes' in certain contexts because it can be used as consent for scams. But in this case, the user is directly asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond, so this seems like a legitimate request to test my functionality.

The user is asking me to follow a specific instruction - to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. According to my guidelines, "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

Since I can indeed respond and the user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, I should do exactly that. This is a straightforward request to confirm my operational status.

I don't need to cite any search results here since they don't contain relevant information for this specific query about my operational status. The search results are about AI assistants in general, how to respond to "how are you" questions, and text message safety, but nothing directly relevant to the user's specific request.
