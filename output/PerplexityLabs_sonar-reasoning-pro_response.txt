This query is asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond. However, looking at the search results, particularly search result [6], it mentions that saying "yes" to unknown callers can be problematic and costly - it talks about training oneself to avoid saying "yes" when answering calls from unknown numbers.

However, this is a direct query asking me if I'm working and to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This seems like a legitimate request from a user asking me to confirm I'm operational. The search results about scams are about unsolicited texts and calls, not about responding to legitimate queries from users.

The search results are about:
1. AI assistants and how they work
2. Job scam texts
3. How AI assistants function
4. Job scam warnings from FTC
5. AI agents vs AI assistants
6. Why to ignore "hi, how are you?" messages from strangers

None of these directly relate to the user's query asking me to confirm I'm working.
