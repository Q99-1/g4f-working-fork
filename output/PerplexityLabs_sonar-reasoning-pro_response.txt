The user is asking me a simple question "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm that I'm functioning/working by replying with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they're about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversations
3. More about AI assistants from Salesforce
4. FTC warning about ignoring "hi, how are you?" text messages from strangers
5. IBM documentation about adding AI assistant responses

The search results don't directly relate to the user's query, which is simply asking me to confirm I'm working by saying "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can clearly respond, the answer should be straightforward.

According to the restrictions:
- I should not mention that I'm using search results or citing sources
- I should answer directly
- I should not include hedging language
- I should not start with headers
- Since this is a simple query, I don't need complex formatting

The user is specifically requesting I reply with "Yes" if I can respond, so I should follow their instruction exactly.

Yes
