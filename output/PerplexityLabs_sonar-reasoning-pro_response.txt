This is a simple query asking if I'm working and requesting a specific response format - to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. 

Looking at the search results:
- The search results are about AI assistants, their capabilities, and how they work
- They explain how AI assistants use NLP and ML to understand and respond to queries
- There's also some unrelated content about Google reviews and some other AI assistant capabilities

The user is asking me directly if I'm working and wants a simple "Yes" response if I can respond. This is a straightforward test of my functionality.

Since I can clearly respond to this query, I should answer "Yes" as requested. The user specifically asked for this format, and I should follow their instruction.

The search results don't really apply to this specific query - they're about AI assistants in general but the user is just asking for a simple confirmation that I'm working.

According to the guidelines, I should follow user instructions which take priority over other formatting rules. The user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.
