The user is asking a simple question about whether I'm working and specifically requesting that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a straightforward test question to see if I'm functional.

Looking at the search results, they don't contain any relevant information about this query. The search results are about:
1. F5 Distributed Cloud Services AI Assistant
2. How to reply to job offers
3. Responsive.io AI Assistant usage
4. How to respond to "How are you?"
5. AssistantResponse class in AI SDK

None of these are relevant to the simple question of whether I'm working/can respond.

According to the guidelines:
- If search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer to the best of my ability using existing knowledge
- The user has given me a specific instruction to reply with "Yes" if I can respond
- Following user instructions takes priority over other formatting rules

Since I can clearly respond and the user has specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond, I should do exactly that.
