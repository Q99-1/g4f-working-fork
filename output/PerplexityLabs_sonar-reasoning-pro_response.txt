The user is asking me a simple question about whether I'm working and they want me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very straightforward query that doesn't require complex search results analysis. The user is specifically asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, job offer responses, AI assistant responses in IBM Watson, how to respond to "How are you?", and using AI Assistant tools. None of these are directly relevant to answering the simple question "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

Since the user is asking me directly if I'm working and requesting a specific response format ('Yes' if I can respond), and I can indeed respond, I should simply answer 'Yes' as requested. The search results don't provide any relevant information for this query, so I should answer based on the direct question asked.

The user has given me a specific instruction to follow: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Following user instructions takes priority over other formatting rules as stated in the guidelines.
