The user is asking a simple question to check if I'm working/functioning. They specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't require any search results or complex formatting. The user is explicitly requesting a specific format for my response.

Looking at the search results provided, they contain information about:
1. AI assistants and how they work
2. How to reply to job offers
3. Adding AI assistant responses in IBM systems
4. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversation
5. Using AI Assistant tool in some platform

None of these search results are relevant to the user's simple query asking if I'm working and requesting a 'Yes' response if I can respond.

According to the guidelines:
- I should follow user instructions (they asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond)
- If search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer to the best of my ability
- I should follow user instruction which takes priority over formatting rules

Since the user specifically requested "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond" and this is a simple functional check, I should simply respond with "Yes" as requested.
