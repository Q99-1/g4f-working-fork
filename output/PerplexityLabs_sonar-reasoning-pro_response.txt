The user is asking me if I'm working and asking me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This seems like a simple greeting/status check query.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, how to respond to "how are you" messages, and some warnings about scam texts. The fourth search result from the FTC is particularly interesting - it warns about not responding to "hi, how are you?" text messages from strangers, and mentions avoiding saying "yes" because it can be used as consent to something in scam calls.

However, the user here is directly asking me to respond and this is clearly a legitimate interaction with an AI assistant (me), not a scam scenario. The search results about AI assistants describe how they work and respond to queries.

The user is asking a direct question and requesting a specific response format. This isn't a scam scenario - this is a user testing if I'm functional and available to help. I should respond naturally and confirm that I can help them.

I should not cite the search results since they're not directly relevant to answering whether I'm working/can respond. The search results are about AI assistants in general, how to respond to greetings, and scam warnings, but none directly address how I should respond to this specific query about my availability.

I should give a straightforward, helpful response confirming I can assist them.

Yes, I'm working and ready to help you with any questions or tasks you have. How can I assist you today?
