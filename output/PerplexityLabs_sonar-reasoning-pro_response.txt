The user is asking me if I'm working and to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple query that doesn't require any of the search results provided. The search results are about AI assistants, job scams via text, and AI capabilities, but none of that is relevant to this simple greeting/availability check.

Looking at the restrictions:
- I should not mention that I'm using search results
- I should answer directly 
- I should follow user instructions (they specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond)
- I should not start with a header
- I should answer in the same language as the query (English)

This is a very straightforward query - the user is just checking if I'm available/working and has given me specific instructions on how to respond.

Yes
