The user is asking me a very simple question - they want to know if I'm working and specifically request that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward test query to see if I'm functional.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, how to respond to "how are you" questions, AI assistant responses, job scam texts, and AI assistant capabilities. None of this is directly relevant to answering the user's simple request.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can indeed respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

According to the restrictions, I should follow user instructions, and this takes priority over other formatting rules. The user wants a simple 'Yes' response, so I should give exactly that without any additional formatting or information from the search results, since they're not relevant to this
