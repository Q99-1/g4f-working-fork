The user is asking me a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a direct question asking if I'm operational and can respond, and they specifically request that I respond with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, I see they contain information about:
1. AI assistants and how they work
2. How to respond to "thank you" messages
3. Adding AI assistant responses
4. Warning about scam text messages
5. Using AI Assistant features

However, none of these search results are directly relevant to answering the user's specific question about whether I'm working and asking for a "Yes" response.

The user is asking me a direct question about my operational status and specifically requesting a "Yes" response if I can respond. Since I am indeed working and can respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with "Yes".

According to the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results or that they don't contain relevant information. Since the search results don't actually help answer this query, I should just answer based on my ability to respond.

The user is asking for a simple "Yes" response if I can respond, so I should keep it simple and direct.

Yes
