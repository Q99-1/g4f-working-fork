The user is asking a simple question about whether I'm working and specifically requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't require any search results - it's just asking about my operational status.

Looking at the search results provided, they are about AI assistants in general and job scams via text messages. None of these are relevant to answering the user's simple question about whether I'm working.

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. However, in this case, the query is asking about my own operational status, which I can answer directly without needing search results.

The user has given me a specific instruction to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This falls under point 8 in the rules: "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow. Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

So I should simply respond with "Yes" as requested.

Yes
