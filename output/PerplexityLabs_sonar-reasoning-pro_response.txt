The user is asking a simple question - "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This seems to be a basic test to see if I'm functioning. 

Looking at the search results provided, they are about AI assistants and their capabilities, but this isn't relevant to the simple query being asked. The user just wants to know if I'm working and specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Since I can respond, I should simply say "Yes" as requested. This is a straightforward query that doesn't require complex formatting, headers, or citing the search results. The search results are about AI assistant capabilities in general but don't contain information specifically about my current status or functioning.

Following the guidelines:
1. I should answer directly 
2. The search results aren't relevant to this specific query about my current status
3. I should follow the user's specific instruction to reply with "Yes" if I can respond
4. I shouldn't mention using search results since they're not relevant
5. No complex formatting is needed for such a simple query

This is a simple functional test, not a complex query requiring detailed analysis or multiple sections.
