The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking if I'm functional/working, and they specifically request that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results provided, they seem to be about AI assistants, email responses, and how to respond to queries, but they don't directly address this specific question. The search results are about:

1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to respond to recruiter emails
3. Adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson
4. How to respond to "How are you?" 
5. Using AI Assistant features

None of these directly answer the user's simple question about whether I'm working/can respond.

According to the restrictions, if the search results don't provide an answer, I should respond saying the information is not available. However, this is a very simple direct question about my functionality, and the user is specifically asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond. This seems like it falls under following user instructions which takes priority.

The user instruction is clear: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond (I'm clearly working), I should follow their instruction and reply with "Yes."

This doesn't seem to require any complex formatting or headers since it's just a simple response.
