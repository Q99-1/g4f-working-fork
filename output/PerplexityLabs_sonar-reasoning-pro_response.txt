This query is asking me a direct question about whether I'm working and asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond. The user seems to be testing if I'm active/available.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. AI assistants and their functionality
2. How to respond to "How are you?" greetings
3. AI assistant responses in technical systems
4. Warning about suspicious text messages that ask "hi, how are you?" 
5. Using AI Assistant tools for generating responses

The search results don't directly address this specific query about whether I'm working, but there is some relevant context in result [4] about being cautious with unknown messages asking simple questions like "hi, how are you?" and avoiding saying "yes" to unknown callers as it could be used as consent.

However, this appears to be a legitimate user interaction where someone is simply checking if I'm available to help. The user is asking me to confirm I can respond, which is a reasonable request. I should respond directly and naturally.

Since this is a simple, direct question and the user is asking for a specific response format, I should:
1. Confirm that I'm working/available
2. Be helpful and ready to assist with whatever they need

The search results aren't particularly relevant to answering this specific query, so I'll answer based on the direct question asked.
</think>

Yes, I'm working and ready to help you with whatever you need. How can I assist you today?
