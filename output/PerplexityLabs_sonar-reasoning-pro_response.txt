The user is asking me if I'm working and specifically requesting that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a very simple query that doesn't require me to use the search results, as it's just asking about my operational status.

The user has given me a specific instruction to reply with "Yes" if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction. The search results are about AI assistants in general and how to respond to "How are you?" but that's not what's being asked here.

According to the guidelines, I should follow user instructions that take priority over other formatting rules. The user is asking for a simple "Yes" response if I can respond.

I should not use any headers since this is a simple response, and I should not cite the search results since they're not relevant to this specific query about my operational status.

Yes
