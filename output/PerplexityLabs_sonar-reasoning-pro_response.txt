The user is asking "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a very straightforward query. They want me to confirm if I'm working/functioning by replying with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, I don't see anything directly relevant to this specific query. The search results contain:
1. General information about AI assistants
2. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversations
3. Adding AI assistant responses (technical documentation)
4. About ignoring text messages from strangers
5. Using AI Assistant features

None of these really apply to the user's simple request to confirm if I'm working.

Since the search results don't contain relevant information for this query, I should answer using my existing knowledge. The user is asking me to confirm if I'm working/functioning, and they specifically requested a "Yes" response if I can respond.

I should follow the restrictions:
- Don't mention search results
- Answer directly
- Don't start with a header
- Be concise since this is a simple query

The user is essentially testing if I'm operational, so a simple confirmation is appropriate.
