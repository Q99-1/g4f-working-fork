The user is asking me a simple question about whether I'm working and requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't require me to use the search results provided. The search results are about AI assistants, job scams, and chat response tools, which are not relevant to this simple question.

Based on the instructions, I should:
1. Answer the query directly 
2. If search results are empty or unhelpful (which they are in this case), I should answer to the best of my ability using existing knowledge
3. Never mention that I'm using search results or citing sources
4. Follow the user's specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond

Since I can clearly respond to the user's query, I should reply with 'Yes' as requested. This is a simple query that doesn't need headers, formatting, or elaborate explanations.

Yes
