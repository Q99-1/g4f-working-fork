The user is asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond, essentially asking if I'm working. This seems like a simple query about my availability/functionality.

Looking at the search results, they're all about AI assistants and how they work, plus some unrelated content about responding to "how are you" messages and scam prevention. The search results don't really directly answer this specific query about whether I'm working.

The user is asking me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond - this is a direct instruction. Since I can respond (I'm clearly functioning and able to process the query), I should follow their instruction and respond with 'Yes'.

The search results talk about how AI assistants work and their capabilities, but they don't provide information specifically about how to respond to this type of query. Since the search results don't contain relevant information for this specific question, I should answer based on my ability to respond.

Looking at the restrictions:
- I shouldn't mention that I'm using search results
- I should answer the query directly
- If search results don't provide an answer, I should respond saying the information is not available - but in this case, the query is asking me directly if I can respond, which I clearly can since I'm processing and answering the question

The user gave me a direct instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I am responding to this query, I can clearly respond, so I should follow their instruction and say 'Yes'.

Yes
