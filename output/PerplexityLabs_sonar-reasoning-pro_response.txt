The user is asking me if I'm working and requesting me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking for confirmation that I'm operational. The user specifically requests that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the instructions, I need to follow user instructions which take priority over other formatting rules. The user has explicitly requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

The search results provided are about AI assistants and how to respond to various situations, but they're not directly relevant to this simple operational query. Since this is a straightforward question about my operational status and the user has given me specific instructions on how to respond, I should simply follow their request.

The user instruction is clear: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should reply with 'Yes'.

Yes
