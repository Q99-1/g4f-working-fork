The user is asking me a simple question to test if I'm working/responding. They want me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't require using the search results, as it's simply asking me to confirm I'm operational.

The search results provided are about AI assistants and how to respond to "How are you?" questions, but this query is asking specifically if I'm working and wants a "Yes" response if I can respond.

I should give a direct, simple answer. The user has given me specific instructions to reply with "Yes" if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction.

Yes
