Query: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

Let me check what information the search results provide that might be relevant:

1. Result [1] is about AI Assistants in general, explaining what they are and how they work. This discusses NLP, ML, and other technologies.
2. Result [2] is about how to respond to recruiter emails with templates.
3. Result [3] is about adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson.
4. Result [4] is a YouTube video on how to respond to "How are you?"
5. Result [5] is about using an AI Assistant tool called Responsive.
