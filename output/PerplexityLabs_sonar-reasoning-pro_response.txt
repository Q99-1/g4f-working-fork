The user is asking me "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

Looking at the search results, I can see there are some articles about AI assistants and how they work, as well as some content about responding to "how are you" messages and scam texts. 

One of the search results (result 4) mentions something about scam texts that say "hi, how are you?" and warns about responding with "Yes" to unknown numbers because it can be used for scams. It specifically mentions: "I had to train myself to answer the phone with "What is it?" when I don't know who's calling. It was difficult at first, but a little practice and you can do it. Avoid saying 'yes' or yeah or yep. Anything that can be used as you consenting to something."

However, the user is directly asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is not a scam situation - this is a direct instruction from the user about how they want me to respond. The user is testing if I'm working/functional and has specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Following the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results. I should just respond naturally. Since the user has explicitly requested I respond with 'Yes' if I can respond, and I can indeed respond, I should follow their instruction.

The user instruction says "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here." So I should follow their specific request to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.
