The user is asking a very straightforward question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a simple test query to see if I'm functioning. The user has explicitly requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should simply answer "Yes" as requested.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and how they work, as well as some content about how to respond to "How are you?" questions in general conversation. However, none of this is directly relevant to the user's specific query, which is just asking me to confirm I'm working by responding with "Yes."

The user has given me a specific instruction to follow: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should follow this instruction exactly.

I should not overcomplicate this or add unnecessary information from the search results, as the user's request is very clear and direct.

Yes
