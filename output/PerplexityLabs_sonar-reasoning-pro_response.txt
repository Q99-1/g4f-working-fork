This is a simple query asking if I can respond, and the user wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a straightforward test query to see if the AI assistant is functional.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants in general, how to respond to "How are you?" conversationally, and AI assistant capabilities. However, none of this information is directly relevant to answering the specific query "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

The user is asking for a very simple response - just "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can clearly respond (I'm processing and answering this query), the appropriate response is simply "Yes" as requested.

I should not cite the search results since they don't contain relevant information for this specific query. The restrictions say if search results don't provide an answer, I should respond based on my ability, and in this case, the answer is straightforward - I can respond, so I should say "Yes" as requested.

Yes
