The user is asking a simple question to check if I'm working/responding, and they specifically request that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't require complex analysis or formatting.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, how they work, and some unrelated content about job scams and conversation responses. However, none of this is directly relevant to answering the user's simple query about whether I'm working.

The user has specifically instructed me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction. This falls under the rule about following user instructions taking priority over other formatting rules.

Since this is a very simple query that doesn't require detailed analysis or complex formatting, I should just give a direct, brief response as requested.

Yes
