Let me analyze this query carefully. The user is asking "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This seems like a simple query where someone is testing if I'm functional and available to respond. However, I need to be careful here because of the search results provided. Looking at search result [2], there's a discussion about scam text messages that often start with "hi, how are you?" and the article mentions being cautious about saying "yes" or "yeah" or "yep" because "Anything that can be used as you consenting to something."

The search result specifically mentions:
"Avoid saying 'yes' or yeah or yep. Anything that can be used as you consenting to something."
"Calls to me (when I do answer) go something like this: What is it? Is this Joe? What is it? Are you Joe? What is it? And they hang up. Guess they wanted me to say "Yes"."

However, this appears to be in the context of phone scams and unknown callers/texters, not legitimate AI assistant interactions. The user is asking me directly as an AI assistant if I'm working and specifically requesting a "Yes" response if I can respond.

But I should be careful here. The search results suggest there could be scam implications with simply saying "Yes" in some contexts. However, this is a direct query to me as an AI assistant, and the user is specifically asking for a "Yes" response to confirm I'm working.

Looking at the other search results, they discuss:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work [1]
2. Scam prevention related to unknown text messages [2] 
3. How AI assistants format responses [3]
4. How to respond to "how are you" in conversation [4]
5. AI assistant features and functionality [5]

The query is asking me to confirm I'm working and specifically requests a "Yes" response. This is a legitimate interaction with an AI assistant, not a scam scenario. 

I recognize the potential security concerns while understanding this is a straightforward request from a user. I'll respond directly and confidently, balancing awareness with clear communication. The context is clearly a direct interaction seeking confirmation of my operational status, so a simple affirmative response is appropriate
