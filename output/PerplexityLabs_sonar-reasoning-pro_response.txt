The user is asking me if I'm working and to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query to test if I'm functioning. The search results provided are about AI assistants, email etiquette, and how to respond to "how are you?" - none of which are directly relevant to this query.

According to the restrictions, I should not say "According to the search results" or similar phrases. Since the search results don't contain information relevant to answering whether I'm working, I should answer based on my existing knowledge as instructed in guideline 3.

The user specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction directly. This is a simple response that doesn't require complex formatting or citations.

Looking at the query type rules, this doesn't fall into any of the specific categories listed (Academic Research, Coding, People, Weather, etc.), so I should provide a straightforward answer.

The user asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should do exactly that.

Yes
