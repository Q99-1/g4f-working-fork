The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very simple query - they just want to know if I'm functioning and able to respond to them.

Looking at the search results, they don't really contain relevant information for answering this specific query. The search results are about:
1. How AI assistants work in general
2. How to respond to recruiter emails  
3. Adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson
4. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversation
5. Using AI Assistant features in a help system

None of these directly address the user's simple question about whether I'm working/can respond.

According to the restrictions, if the search results don't provide an answer, I should respond saying the information is not available. However, in this case, the user is asking me directly if I can respond - which I obviously can since I'm responding to them. This is more of a test/check of my functionality rather than a query that would require search results.

The user specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can respond (evidenced by the fact that I'm responding), I should follow their instruction and say 'Yes'.

I should not mention search results or cite anything since this is a direct functional question about my ability to respond.

Yes
