The user is asking a simple question about whether I'm working and specifically requesting a "Yes" response if I can respond. This is a very straightforward query that doesn't require the use of search results at all. 

Looking at the search results provided:
1. The first result is about AI assistants and their capabilities
2. The second result is about different ways to say yes and no in English
3. The third result is about AI assistant capabilities for work

None of these search results are relevant to answering the simple question "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

According to the guidelines, if the search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer the query to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge. This is a case where the search results are unhelpful for this specific query.

The user is simply asking if I'm functioning and can respond, and they've specifically requested a "Yes" response if I can. Since I can respond, the appropriate answer is "Yes" as requested.

I should not mention that I'm using search results or citing sources since the search results are not relevant to this query. I should just answer directly and naturally.

Yes.
