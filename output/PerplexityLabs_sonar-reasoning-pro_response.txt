The user is asking me a simple question - "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a very straightforward query asking me to confirm if I'm functioning/available to help them.

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants in general, communication styles for saying yes/no/maybe, AI assistant capabilities, and how to reply to job offers. These search results aren't really relevant to the user's simple question about whether I'm working/available.

According to the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results or citing sources. I should answer directly. Since the search results don't really provide useful information for this simple query, I should answer based on my existing knowledge.

The user specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I am indeed able to respond to their query, the appropriate answer is simply "Yes."

I should not start with a header since this is a very simple query that doesn't require multiple sections to answer. I should keep it straightforward and direct.

Yes, I'm working and ready to help you with any questions or tasks you have.
