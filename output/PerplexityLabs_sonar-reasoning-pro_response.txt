The user is asking me "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a simple query asking for confirmation that I'm functioning and can provide responses. They specifically want me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants in general - their capabilities, how they work, what technologies they use (NLP, ML, etc.), and how to format AI assistant responses. However, none of these search results directly address the user's simple question about whether I'm working.

Since this is a direct question about my current operational status and the user has given me a specific instruction to reply with "Yes" if I can respond, I should follow their instruction. The search results don't contain relevant information for this specific query, so I should answer based on my ability to respond.

According to the restrictions, if search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer to the best of my ability using existing knowledge. The search results here are about AI assistants in general but don't address my specific operational status.

The user wants a simple "Yes" response if I can respond, so I should provide that.

Yes
