The user is asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple greeting/check to see if I'm working. The search results don't really contain information relevant to answering this specific query - they're about AI assistants in general, how to respond to "how are you" questions, security warnings about responding to unknown texts, and technical documentation about AI assistant responses.

Since this is a direct question asking me to confirm I can respond, and they specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, I should simply do that. The search results aren't helpful for this particular query, so I'll answer based on my ability to respond.

Looking at the restrictions:
- I shouldn't mention search results
- I should answer directly 
- I shouldn't start with a header
- I should be concise since this is a simple query

The user is asking for a very specific response format, so I should follow their instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Yes.
