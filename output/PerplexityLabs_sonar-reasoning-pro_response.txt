The user is asking a simple question about whether I'm working and they want me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't really need the search results, as it's asking about my current operational status.

Looking at the search results:
1. About AI assistants and their functionality 
2. About how to respond to "How are you?" in conversations
3. About adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson
4. About ignoring "hi, how are you?" text messages from strangers (which is actually about scam prevention)
5. About using an AI Assistant feature in some platform

None of these search results are directly relevant to answering whether I'm working or operational. The search results don't contain information about my specific status.

The user is asking for a simple "Yes" response if I can respond. Since I can clearly respond to their query, the answer should be "Yes" as requested.

The restrictions say I should not mention that I'm using search results or citing sources, and I should answer directly. Since the search results don't help answer this specific question about my operational status, I should answer based on my ability to respond.

The user specifically requested a simple response format - just "Yes" if I can respond. I should follow their instruction.

Yes
