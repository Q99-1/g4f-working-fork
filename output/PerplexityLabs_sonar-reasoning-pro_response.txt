This is a very simple query asking if I'm working and requesting a specific response format - just "Yes" if I can respond. The user is essentially testing if I'm functioning and available.

Looking at the search results provided:
1. Information about AI assistants and how they work
2. How to reply to job offers 
3. More about AI assistant capabilities
4. How to respond to "How are you?" 
5. Technical documentation about AI assistant responses

None of these search results are directly relevant to answering this simple query. The user is asking me directly if I'm working and wants a "Yes" response if I can respond. 

According to the restrictions, if search results don't provide an answer, I should respond using my existing knowledge. This is a straightforward request - the user wants to know if I'm functioning, and they've requested a specific format.

The user specifically asked me to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a clear instruction that I should follow according to guideline 8 which states "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow... Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

So I should simply respond with "Yes" as
