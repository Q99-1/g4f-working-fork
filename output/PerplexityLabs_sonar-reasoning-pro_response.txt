The user is asking me a very simple question - whether I'm working and to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a basic test query to see if I'm functioning.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. AI assistant capabilities for work
2. How to reply to or forward email messages in Microsoft Outlook  
3. Adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson
4. A truncated result about OpenAI community

None of these search results are relevant to answering the simple question "are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. However, this is a direct question to me about my functionality, not a query that requires search results. The user is simply testing if I'm working.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Following user instructions takes priority over other formatting rules as stated in the guidelines.

This is a simple, direct query that doesn't require complex formatting, headers, or citations. I should simply respond with "Yes" as requested.

Yes
