The user is asking if I'm working and specifically requesting that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple query to test if I'm functioning. The search results provided are about AI assistant capabilities, job offer responses, and how to respond to "how are you" questions, but they're not directly relevant to this specific query.

The user has given me a clear instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can indeed respond, I should simply reply with "Yes" as requested. This is straightforward and doesn't require any complex formatting or citations since the search results aren't relevant to answering this specific query.

Looking at the restrictions, I need to:
1. Not include URLs or links
2. Not begin with a header
3. Answer in the same language as the query (English)
4. Follow the user's specific instruction to reply with "Yes" if I can respond

This is a simple, direct query that just needs a simple, direct answer.

Yes
