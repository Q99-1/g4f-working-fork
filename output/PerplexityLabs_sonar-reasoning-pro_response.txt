The user is asking me if I'm working and specifically requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my operational status.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. How AI assistants work
2. How to reply to job offers
3. AI assistant technology and capabilities
4. How to respond to "How are you?"
5. Adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson

None of these search results are directly relevant to answering whether I'm working or operational. The search results don't contain information about my specific status or how to respond to operational queries.

Since the search results are not helpful for this specific query, I should answer based on my existing knowledge. The user has given me a clear instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, and since I am indeed able to respond to their query, I should follow their instruction.

The user is asking for a simple response, so I don't need to use headers or elaborate formatting. I should just provide the requested response.

Yes
