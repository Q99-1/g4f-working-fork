The user is asking me a simple question - "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This seems to be a simple test to see if I'm functional and can respond. They're specifically asking me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. AI assistants and their capabilities
2. How to respond to "How are you?" greetings
3. Adding AI assistant responses
4. Warning about ignoring "hi, how are you?" text messages from strangers (scam prevention)
5. AI Assistant capabilities in some platform

The search results don't really relate to the user's query. The user is simply asking if I'm working and requesting a "Yes" response if I can respond.

According to the restrictions, if search results don't provide an answer, I should respond saying the information is not available. However, this is a simple query about my functionality, not something that requires search results.

The user is giving me a direct instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should follow their instruction and simply reply "Yes".

This falls under the rule: "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow. Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

So I should simply respond with "Yes" as requested.

Yes
