The user is asking me a direct question "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This seems to be a simple test to see if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain various information about:
1. F5's AI Assistant for Distributed Cloud Services
2. A YouTube video about how to respond to "How are you?" 
3. IBM documentation about adding AI assistant responses
4. FTC consumer alert about ignoring "hi, how are you?" text messages from strangers
5. OpenAI's assistant API documentation

However, none of these search results are directly relevant to answering the user's simple query asking if I'm working and to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Since the search results are not helpful for this query, I should answer to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge. The user is simply asking if I'm functional and requesting a specific response format.

The user has specifically instructed me to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a clear instruction that I should follow as per the guidelines that say "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

I should provide a simple, direct response as requested.

Yes, I can respond and I'm working properly. How can I help you today?
