This is a simple query asking if I'm working/functional and requesting a specific response format. The user wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. 

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, job offer responses, and general conversation responses, but none of this is directly relevant to answering this simple query about my operational status.

The user is asking for a very straightforward response - just "Yes" if I can respond. Since I am clearly able to respond (I'm processing this query and can provide an answer), the appropriate response is simply "Yes" as requested.

I should not overcomplicate this or add unnecessary information from the search results since they aren't relevant to this specific query. The user gave a clear instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction precisely.

Yes
