The user is asking me if I'm working and specifically asking me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my operational status.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to respond to "How are you?" conversations
3. Information about specific AI assistants from F5 
4. Warning about text message scams that start with "hi, how are you?"
5. Information about configuring AI assistant responses in IBM Watson

The search results don't directly address the user's specific question about whether I'm working. However, the fact that I can process and respond to their query demonstrates that I am indeed functioning.

The user has given me a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should follow their instruction. This is a straightforward operational query, not something that requires extensive search result analysis.

According to the restrictions, I should follow user instructions, and the user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can clearly respond, I should simply answer 'Yes' as requested.

Yes
