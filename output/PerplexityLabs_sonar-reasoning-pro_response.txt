The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my availability/functionality. The search results provided don't really relate to this query - they're about AI assistants in general, job offers, and various other topics that aren't directly relevant to the user's simple question.

Looking at the restrictions, I should:
1. Not include URLs or links
2. Not include bibliographies 
3. Avoid moralization or hedging language
4. Not repeat copyrighted content verbatim
5. Never directly output song lyrics
6. Never begin with a header (and this query doesn't need multiple sections)
7. If search results don't provide an answer, respond that information is not available (but in this case, I can answer the query directly)
8. Never use phrases like "According to the search results" etc.
9. Never use â€¢ symbol
10. Never cite right after code blocks
11. Never use $ or $$ for LaTeX
12. Always answer in same language as query (English)

The user specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a direct instruction that I should follow according to rule 8 in the main instructions: "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow... Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

The search results don't contain relevant information for this query, so I won't be citing any of them. I should simply respond as requested.

Yes.
