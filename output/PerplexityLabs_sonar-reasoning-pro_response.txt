The user is asking if I'm working and requesting I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple greeting/test query to see if I'm functioning. I should follow the user's explicit instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results:
- They contain information about AI assistants, email responses, and general conversation responses
- They don't directly relate to the user's specific request
- The user has given me a specific instruction on how to respond

According to the guidelines, "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here." The user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, which I can.

I should not overthink this - it's a simple test/greeting and the user has been very clear about what response they want.

Yes
