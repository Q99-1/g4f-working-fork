The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm I'm operational and can respond. The user has specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and their capabilities, as well as some unrelated content about job offers. However, this query doesn't really need the search results - it's asking me directly if I'm working/can respond.

The user has given me a specific instruction to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." According to the guidelines, "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

Since I can respond and am working, I should simply reply "Yes" as requested.

I should not mention the search results or cite them since this is a direct query about my functionality, and the user has given specific instructions on how to respond.

Yes
