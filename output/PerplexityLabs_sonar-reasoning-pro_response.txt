This is a simple query asking if I am working and requesting a specific response format ("Yes" if I can respond). The user is essentially testing if I'm functioning.

Looking at the search results:
1. The first result is about AI assistants in general and their capabilities
2. The second is about how to respond to "How are you?" in conversation
3. The third is about adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson
4. The fourth is about job scam texts
5. The fifth is about AI assistant capabilities

None of these search results are directly relevant to answering the simple question "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. However, this is a simple greeting/test query that I can answer directly based on my existing knowledge without needing to cite search results.

The user is asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond, which is a direct instruction I should follow. According to rule 8 in the guidelines, "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow... Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

So I should simply respond "Yes" as requested since I am indeed functioning and can respond.
