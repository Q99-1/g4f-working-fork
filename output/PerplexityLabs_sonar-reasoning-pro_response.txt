The user is asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple query asking for confirmation that I'm working/functional. 

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, how to respond to "how are you" questions, and some warnings about scam messages. However, none of this is directly relevant to the user's simple request.

The user is asking me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can respond, the appropriate answer would be "Yes" as requested.

However, I need to be careful about the restriction that says "Avoid saying 'yes' or yeah or yep. Anything that can be used as you consenting to something" from search result [4]. But this is in the context of phone scams and unknown callers, not a legitimate interaction where someone is simply asking if I'm functional.

The user's query is straightforward - they want to know if I'm working and have specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is not a scam scenario, it's a normal functionality check.

I should provide a direct answer as requested.

Yes
