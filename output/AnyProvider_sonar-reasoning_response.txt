This query is asking me to respond with a simple confirmation - "Yes" if I can respond. The user is essentially testing if I'm functioning/working. 

Looking at the search results:
1. The first result is about what AI assistants are and how they work
2. The second is about how to respond to "How are you?" in conversation
3. The third is also about AI assistants
4. The fourth is about ignoring "hi, how are you?" text messages from strangers for security reasons
5. The fifth is about adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson

None of these search results are particularly relevant to answering this simple query. The query is very straightforward - it's asking if I'm working and to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

However, I notice search result [4] mentions something interesting about avoiding saying "yes" in certain contexts due to scam concerns: "Avoid saying 'yes' or yeah or yep. Anything that can be used as you consenting to something." But this is in the context of unknown phone callers, not a legitimate interaction with an AI assistant.

The user is directly asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond, which is a simple functionality test. This is a legitimate request and I should follow their instruction. The search results don't provide useful information for this query, so I'll answer based on my ability to respond to the user.

The user specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction directly.
