The user is asking a simple question "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a very straightforward query asking me to confirm if I'm operational and can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. AI assistants and how they work
2. How to respond to "How are you?" 
3. Adding AI assistant responses
4. How to respond to job interview requests
5. Using AI Assistant tools

None of these search results are directly relevant to the user's simple query asking me to confirm I'm working. The search results don't contain information that would help answer this specific question.

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. However, this is a direct question to me about my operational status, not a question that requires search results to answer.

The user is asking me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should simply say "Yes" as requested.

Looking at the query type rules, this doesn't fall into any of the specific categories listed. It's just a simple direct question to me.

The user specifically requested that I "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond" - this is a clear instruction that I should follow according to rule 8: "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow... Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

So I should simply reply "Yes" as requested.

Yes
