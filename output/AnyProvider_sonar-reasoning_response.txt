The user is asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond, and asking if I'm working. This is a simple greeting/testing query to see if I'm functioning. 

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, how they work, and some information about responding to greetings like "How are you?" but this doesn't directly relate to the user's simple question.

According to the restrictions:
- I should not start with a header
- I should answer directly
- I should not mention using search results
- The user is asking for a specific response format ("Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond")

The user is specifically requesting that I follow their instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. According to rule 8: "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow... Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

So I should simply respond with "Yes" as requested.

Yes
