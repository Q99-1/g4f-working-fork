The user is asking a simple question - "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm that I'm operational and can respond. They've specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and how they work, but this is not really relevant to the user's simple query. The user is just asking for confirmation that I'm working.

Since this is a simple confirmation request, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes' as requested. The search results aren't really needed for this type of query - it's just a basic operational check.

According to the restrictions, I should not start with headers, and I should be direct. The user has given me specific instructions to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction.

Since this is such a simple request, I don't need to cite any search results or provide extensive formatting. A simple, direct response is most appropriate here.

Yes.
