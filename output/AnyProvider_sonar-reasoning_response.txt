The user is asking me if I'm working and requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query to test if I'm functioning.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, their capabilities, how they work, and some unrelated content about job offer scams and text messaging etiquette. However, none of this is directly relevant to answering the user's simple question.

The user has given me a clear instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

According to the restrictions, I should follow user instructions, and the user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This takes priority over other formatting rules.

The search results are not relevant to this query, so I don't need to cite them. The user is simply testing if I'm working/functioning.

Yes
