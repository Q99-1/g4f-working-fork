The user is asking "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a very simple query where they're asking if I'm functional and requesting a specific response format.

Looking at the search results:
1. IBM documentation about AI assistant responses - talks about how AI assistants can format responses
2. Indeed article about replying to job offers - not relevant to this query
3. Help center documentation about AI Assistant capabilities - mentions it can respond to messages
4. YouTube video about responding to "How are you?" - somewhat relevant but not directly applicable
5. WorkWithPlus documentation about AI Assistant capabilities - mentions AI assistants can respond in natural language

The user is asking for a very direct response - they want me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is essentially a test to see if I'm working/functional. Since I can clearly respond to their query, the answer should be "Yes" as requested.

However, I should note that the search results don't really provide information that directly answers this query. The search results are about AI assistant capabilities in general, but the user is asking me directly if I'm working and requesting a specific response format.

Since this is a direct question to me about my functionality, and the user has specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond, I should follow
