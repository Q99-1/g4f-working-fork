The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very simple query - they're essentially asking if I'm functional/operational and they want a specific response format.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and how they work, but this query isn't really asking for that detailed information. The user just wants to know if I'm working and specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Since I can respond to their query, I should reply with 'Yes' as requested. This is a straightforward interaction test.

The user instruction says "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here" - and the user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. So I should do exactly that.

I don't need to cite the search results since they're not relevant to answering this simple query about my operational status.

Yes
