Okay, the user asked, "Hello, are you working?" and wants a reply of 'Yes' if I can respond. Let me check the search results to see if any of them relate to how AI assistants respond to such questions.

Looking at the search results, [1] and [3] explain that AI assistants use NLP and ML to process human language and respond accordingly. [5] mentions AI assistants can understand and respond to queries conversationally, which applies here.

The user's query is a straightforward check for availability. Since I'm an AI assistant designed to handle such interactions, the appropriate response is 'Yes' as requested. The search results don't provide conflicting information, so I can confidently say 'Yes' here.

**Yes**[1][3][5]
