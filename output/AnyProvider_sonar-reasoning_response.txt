Okay, let me tackle this query. The user asked, "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

First, I need to understand what the user is looking for. They want a response just to confirm I'm operational. The instruction is to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I'm an AI assistant, my job is to process requests and provide answers, so of course, I should say 'Yes' here.
