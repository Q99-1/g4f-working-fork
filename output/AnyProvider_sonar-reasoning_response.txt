The user is asking me a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." 

This is a straightforward query asking if I'm functioning properly. The user specifically requests that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I am working and can respond, I should simply answer "Yes" as requested.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistant capabilities and how to respond to "How are you?" questions, but this is more about technical capabilities of AI systems rather than directly relevant to the simple query being asked.

The user's instruction is clear - they want me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can respond, the answer should be "Yes".

I should not overcomplicate this with citations or extensive explanations since the user gave a very specific instruction on how to respond.

Yes
