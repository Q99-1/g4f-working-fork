The user is asking me "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." 

This is a simple greeting/check to see if I'm functional. They specifically asked me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results provided:
- Result [1] is about AI assistants and their technology
- Result [2] is about how to respond to "How are you?" 
- Result [3] is about adding AI assistant responses in some platform
- Result [4] is about ignoring text messages from strangers
- Result [5] is about using AI Assistant in some customer service platform

None of these search results are particularly relevant to the user's simple query asking if I'm working and to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. The user is just checking if I'm functional.

According to my instructions, if the search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer the query to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge. In this case, the search results don't help answer this simple functional check, so I should just respond directly.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should reply with "Yes" as requested.

I should not use any headers or complex formatting for such a simple response. I should not mention search results since they're not relevant. I should just give a direct, simple response.

Yes, I'm working and can respond to your questions. How can I help you today?
