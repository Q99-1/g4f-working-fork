The query is very simple: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is asking me to confirm that I'm operational by responding with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can respond to this query, I should simply answer "Yes" as requested.

Looking at the search results provided, they don't contain any information relevant to answering this specific query - they're about AI assistants in general, job offer responses, and other unrelated topics. Since the search results don't provide relevant information for this query, I should answer based on my ability to respond, which I clearly can since I'm formulating this response.

The user is asking for a very simple confirmation that I'm working/operational, and they specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can respond, the answer should be "Yes".

I need to follow the restrictions:
1. Don't mention search results
2. Don't start with a header
3. Answer directly
4. Be concise since this is a simple query

This doesn't fall into any of the specific query types that require special formatting, so I should just give a direct, simple answer.

Yes
