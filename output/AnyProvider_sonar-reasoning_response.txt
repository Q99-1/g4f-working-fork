The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple query asking for confirmation that I'm functioning. 

Looking at the search results, they are about AI assistants, email responses, and how to respond to questions, but none of them directly address this specific query. The search results are not particularly relevant to answering whether I'm working or not.

The user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, which is a direct instruction that I should follow according to the guidelines. Since I can respond, I should answer "Yes" as requested.

Looking at the restrictions:
- I shouldn't mention that I'm using search results
- I should follow user instructions (the user asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond)
- I should answer directly

This is a simple, direct question that doesn't require complex formatting or multiple sections.

Yes
