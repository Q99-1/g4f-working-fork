The user is asking if I'm working and requesting that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This seems like a simple query to test if I'm functioning.

Looking at the search results, I can see some information about AI assistants and their functionality, as well as some content about how to respond to greetings and potential scams involving text messages that ask for "yes" responses.

The search results include:
1. Information about AI assistants and how they work
2. A warning about text message scams where strangers ask "hi, how are you?" and try to get people to say "yes"
3. IBM documentation about AI assistant responses
4. A YouTube video about responding to "how are you?"
5. Information about using AI Assistant features

However, this query is quite straightforward - the user is simply asking if I'm working and requesting a "Yes" response if I can respond. This doesn't appear to be related to the search results about scams or anything malicious. It's a direct question about my functionality.

According to the restrictions, I should not start with phrases like "According to the search results" or "Based on the search results." I should answer directly and naturally.

The user is asking a simple question and requesting a specific response format. I should respond directly to their query.

Yes, I am working and can respond to your questions. I'm fully operational and ready to help you with any queries you might have.
