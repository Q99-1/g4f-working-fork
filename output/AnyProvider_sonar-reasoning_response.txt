The user is asking a simple question about whether I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't require complex formatting or extensive search result analysis. The user has given me a specific instruction to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, how to respond to greetings, AI assistant capabilities, etc. But none of this is really relevant to answering the simple question "Hello, are you working?"

The user's instruction is clear: they want me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can indeed respond (as evidenced by me providing this response), the appropriate answer is simply "Yes" as requested.

This falls under the rule about following user instructions, which takes priority over other formatting rules. The user specifically requested a simple "Yes" response, so I should provide that.

Yes
