The user is asking a simple question "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a very direct query asking me to confirm if I'm functioning and able to respond. They specifically request I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they are about AI assistants and job offers, but none of them directly relate to answering this specific query. The search results discuss:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work (Salesforce)
2. How to reply to job offers (Indeed)  
3. Adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson
4. How to respond to "How are you?" (YouTube)
5. Using AI Assistant tools (Responsive.io)

Since the search results don't contain information relevant to answering this specific query, I should answer based on my existing knowledge. The user is asking if I'm working/functioning and wants a "Yes" response if I can respond.

According to the restrictions, if search results don't provide an answer, I should respond saying the information is not available. However, this is a direct question about my functionality that I can answer directly. The user is asking me to confirm I'm working by replying "Yes" if I can respond.

This is a simple, direct query that doesn't require complex formatting or headers. I should just give a straightforward response as requested.

Yes
