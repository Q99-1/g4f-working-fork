The user is asking a very simple question - they want to know if I'm working and have requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a straightforward test query to see if I'm functional.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, job scams via text messages, and some technical documentation. However, none of this information is directly relevant to answering the user's simple question about whether I'm working.

According to the guidelines:
- I should answer the query directly
- If search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer to the best of my ability using existing knowledge
- The user has specifically requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond
- I should follow user instructions (this takes priority over other formatting rules)

Since this is a simple functionality test and the user has given specific instructions on how to respond, I should simply reply "Yes" as requested. The search results don't contain relevant information for this query, so I don't need to cite anything.

Yes
