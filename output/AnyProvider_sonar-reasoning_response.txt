The user is asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking if I'm working/functional. Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants in general, how to respond to "how are you" messages, and some warnings about scam texts that start with "hi, how are you?"

The search results contain some warnings about not responding with "yes" to unknown text messages as scammers can use that as consent. However, this query is from a user who is directly asking me as an AI assistant if I'm working, so this is a legitimate interaction, not a scam scenario.

The user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward functional check. I should respond directly and simply as requested, since this is clearly a legitimate test of my functionality.

I should not cite the search results here since they're not relevant to answering whether I'm functional, and the query is asking for a simple yes/no response format.

Yes, I can respond and I'm working properly. How can I help you today?
