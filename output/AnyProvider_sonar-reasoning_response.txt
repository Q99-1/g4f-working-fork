Okay, the user's query is "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." So they want a simple 'Yes' from me. But looking at the search results, most of them are about how AI assistants work, handling recruiter emails, and responding to greetings like "How are you?" There's not much directly related to a yes/no response. Let me check each result.

Result [1] explains how AI assistants process language. Since I'm an AI, this might be relevant, but the answer is straightforward here. The user wants a yes. Maybe cite [1] since it's about AI functionality. Results [2] and [4] are about email responses and replying to "How are you?", but not directly answering yes. [3] and [5] talk about AI technologies but again, not the yes answer. The user's instruction is to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can, the answer is simply "Yes". Need to make sure it's just "Yes" with citation.
