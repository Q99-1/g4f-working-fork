The user is asking me if I'm working and specifically requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This appears to be a simple verification query to confirm I'm functional.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, job scams via text messages, and some warnings about avoiding saying "yes" to unknown callers/texts because scammers can use that recorded "yes" to authorize fraudulent charges.

However, this is a direct interaction with me as an AI assistant in a legitimate context, not a scam text message. The user is simply asking me to confirm I'm working. The search results are not directly relevant to answering this specific query - they're more about general AI assistant functionality and scam warnings.

According to the restrictions, I should not use phrases like "According to the search results" or "Based on the search results." I should answer directly and naturally.

The user is asking a simple question and requesting a specific response format. I should respond directly and confirm that I'm working.

Yes, I'm working and can respond to your questions. I'm ready to help you with any queries you might have.
