The user is asking me if I'm working and specifically requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my current operational status.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. How AI assistants work (from Lindy.ai)
2. How to respond to "thank you" in English (YouTube video)
3. What is an AI assistant (from Salesforce) 
4. Why it's not rude to ignore certain text messages (FTC consumer alert)
5. Adding AI assistant responses (IBM documentation)

The search results don't directly address the user's simple question about whether I'm working. However, I can see from search result [4] that there's a mention of being cautious about responding with "yes" to unknown contacts, but this is in the context of potential scams via text messages, not a legitimate interaction with an AI assistant.

The user is directly asking me if I'm working and requesting a specific response format. Since I am indeed operational and can respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes' as requested. This is a straightforward status check, not a complex query requiring detailed analysis of the search results.

The search results don't contain relevant information to answer this specific query, so I should answer based on my current operational status.

Yes
