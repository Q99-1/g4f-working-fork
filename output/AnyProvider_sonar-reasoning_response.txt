The user is asking me if I'm working and specifically requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking me to confirm that I'm operational.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. AI assistants and their capabilities (Salesforce)
2. How to reply to job offers 
3. AI Assistant capabilities in WorkWithPlus
4. How to respond to "How are you?" 
5. ChatGPT capabilities overview

None of these search results are directly relevant to answering whether I'm working or operational. The search results don't contain information about my current status or functionality.

Since the search results are not helpful for this query, I should answer using my existing knowledge. The user is asking a simple question about whether I can respond, and they've specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

The user has given me a specific instruction to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." According to the guidelines, "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

Since I can respond and the user has explicitly requested this format, I should simply reply "Yes" as requested.

Yes
