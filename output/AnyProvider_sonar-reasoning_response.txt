The user is asking me a simple question - "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." They want me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

This is a very straightforward query asking about my operational status. The user is specifically requesting that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I am clearly able to respond (I'm processing and answering this query), the appropriate response is simply "Yes" as requested.

The search results provided are about AI assistants in general, email etiquette, how to respond to "how are you", and AI assistant responses, but none of them are directly relevant to answering this specific query about my working status.

According to the restrictions, I should:
1. Answer the query directly 
2. Not mention that I'm using search results
3. Follow user instructions (which in this case is to reply with "Yes" if I can respond)
4. Not start with a header
5. Answer in the same language as the query (English)

Since the user specifically requested a "Yes" response if I can respond, and I clearly can respond, I should simply say "Yes" as instructed.

Yes
