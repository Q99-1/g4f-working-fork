The user is asking if I'm working and specifically requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple test query to check if I'm functioning.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants in general, some troubleshooting for Google Assistant and Siri not responding, and OpenAI API changes. However, none of this is directly relevant to answering the user's simple question about whether I'm working.

According to the guidelines, if the search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer the query to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge. In this case, the search results don't provide any information relevant to whether I personally am working or can respond.

The user has given me a specific instruction to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can indeed respond (as evidenced by the fact that I'm formulating this response), I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

The guidelines also state that "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here." So I should prioritize the user's specific request to reply with 'Yes'.

This is a very simple query that doesn't require headers, sections, or complex formatting. A direct, brief response is most appropriate here.

Yes
