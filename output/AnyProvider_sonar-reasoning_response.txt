The user is asking a very simple question - they want to know if I'm working and want me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward test query.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. IBM Watson AI assistant responses
2. How to reply to job offers  
3. AI Assistant capabilities
4. How to respond to "How are you?" 
5. Microsoft Teams AI Assistant

None of these search results are particularly relevant to answering the user's simple question. The user is just asking if I'm working and wants a 'Yes' response if I can respond.

According to the restrictions, if the search results don't provide an answer, I should respond saying the information is not available. However, in this case, the user is asking me directly if I can respond, which is a meta-question about my functionality rather than asking for information that would be in search results.
