The user is asking me a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a very straightforward query - they're just testing if I'm functioning and specifically asking me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can obviously respond (I'm answering their query), I should reply with "Yes" as requested.

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants in general, how they work, and some technical documentation. However, none of this information is really relevant to answering the user's simple question. They're just asking if I'm working and want a "Yes" response if I can respond.

According to the guidelines, if the search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer the query to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge. In this case, the search results don't help answer this specific query, so I should just give the straightforward answer they're looking for.

The user is specifically requesting that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond, so that's exactly what I should do. This is a simple test query, not something that requires extensive analysis or citation of the search results.
