The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my status/availability. 

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, job scams via text messages, and some technical guides, but none of this is directly relevant to answering whether I'm working or can respond.

Since the search results don't contain relevant information for this specific query, I should answer based on my existing knowledge. The user is asking me to confirm if I'm operational and can respond, and they've specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

The user has given me a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. According to the guidelines, "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

So I should simply respond with 'Yes' as requested.

Yes
