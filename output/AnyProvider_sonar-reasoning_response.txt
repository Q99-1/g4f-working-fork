Okay, the user sent "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." First, I need to check if I can respond. Since I can generate responses, the answer should be "Yes." But I should look for any search results that might relate to how AI assistants respond.

Looking at the search results, they mainly discuss how AI assistants work using NLP and ML. For example, [1] mentions processing human language and converting input into action. [3] and [5] also talk about understanding queries and responding, which aligns with handling user inputs.

The user's query is a test to see if the response capability is active. Since there's no indication of being unavailable, the appropriate reply is "Yes." There's no need to cite sources here because the question is straightforward and the answer is affirmative. The search results confirm that AI assistants can handle such interactions
