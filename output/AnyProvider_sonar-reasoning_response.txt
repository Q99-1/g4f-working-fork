The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with just "Yes" if I can respond.

Let me analyze this query:
- "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a simple check to see if I'm operational and able to respond to queries. The user specifically requests that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

All the search results provided are background information about AI assistants, but they're not directly relevant to this query. The user isn't asking for information about AI assistants - they're just checking if I'm online and functioning.

Since I am an AI assistant that is currently operational and can respond to queries, the appropriate response would be simply "Yes" as requested.

I should follow the user's instruction precisely and respond with just "Yes" without adding any additional information, since that's what they asked for.

Yes
