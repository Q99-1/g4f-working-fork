The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very simple query asking about my current operational status. The user has given me a specific instruction to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants in general, how to respond to "how are you" questions, and some technical documentation about Microsoft Teams AI Assistant. None of these search results are directly relevant to answering whether I am working or can respond.

According to the guidelines:
- If search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer to the best of my ability using existing knowledge
- I should follow user instructions - the user specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond
- I should not mention that I'm using search results since they're not helpful here

The user instruction is very clear and direct: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can indeed respond, I should follow this instruction exactly.

Yes
