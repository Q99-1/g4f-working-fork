Let me analyze this query. The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm I'm functioning and can respond. The user specifically requests that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. AI assistants and how they work (Salesforce)
2. How to respond to recruiter emails (Indeed) 
3. AI assistant responses in IBM Watson
4. How to respond to "How are you?" (YouTube)
5. Using AI Assistant features (Responsive.io)

None of these search results are particularly relevant to answering this simple query about whether I'm working/can respond. The search results don't contain information that would help me answer this specific question.

Since the search results are not helpful for this query, according to the instructions, I should "answer the query to the best of your ability using your existing knowledge."

The user is asking me to confirm I'm working and can respond, and specifically requests I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I am indeed able to respond to their query, I should reply with "Yes" as requested.

I should follow the user's instruction to reply with "Yes" since they specifically asked for that format if I can respond. I don't need to use any headers or complex formatting for such a simple response.

Yes
