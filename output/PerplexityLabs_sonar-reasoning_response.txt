The user is asking me a simple question "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." They are essentially asking me to confirm if I'm operational/functioning.

Let me check the search results to see if they contain relevant information:

1. The first result is about AI assistants in general from Salesforce - talks about what AI assistants are and their capabilities
2. The second result is about how to respond to "How are you?" questions in social/professional contexts
