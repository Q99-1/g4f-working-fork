<think>
The user is asking a simple question about whether I'm working and asking me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This seems like a straightforward query that doesn't require complex search results analysis. The search results provided don't seem directly relevant to this specific query - they're about AI assistants in general, email replies, job scams, etc. 

Looking at the restrictions and guidelines:
- I should answer the query directly 
- I should not mention using search results
- I should follow user instructions (they specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond)
- This is a simple query that doesn't need headers or complex formatting

Since I can respond and I'm functioning, I should simply reply "Yes" as requested by the user.

Yes
