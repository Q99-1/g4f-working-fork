The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my availability/functionality. The user has specifically instructed me to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

Looking at the search results, they're about AI assistants in general, how they work, their capabilities, etc. But this query is very simple and direct - the user just wants to know if I'm operational and has given me a specific instruction on how to respond.

Since I can respond to the query, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'. This is a straightforward response that doesn't need the search results or extensive formatting. The user's instruction takes priority over other formatting rules as mentioned in the guidelines: "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

The search results aren't really relevant to this simple operational check, so I shouldn't force citations into this response.

Yes
