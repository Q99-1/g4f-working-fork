This query is asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond. The user is essentially testing if I'm working/functional. This is a simple query that doesn't require much detail or formatting. I should simply respond with "Yes" as requested since I am indeed able to respond.

Looking at the search results, they don't seem directly relevant to answering this specific query. The search results are about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversation
3. Adding AI assistant responses in IBM systems
4. Why to ignore "hi, how are you?" messages from strangers
5. Using AI Assistant tools in responsive.io

None of these directly address the user's simple request to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. But in this case, the user is asking me directly if I'm working and to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This isn't really a query that needs search results - it's a direct test of my functionality.

Since I can respond (I'm clearly functioning), I should reply with "Yes" as requested.

Yes.
