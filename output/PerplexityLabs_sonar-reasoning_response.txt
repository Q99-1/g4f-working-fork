The user is asking a simple question to check if I'm working/functional. They specifically ask me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward test query.

Looking at the search results, they're about AI assistants in general and their capabilities, but they're not directly relevant to answering this specific query. The user is just checking if I'm operational.

According to the guidelines:
- I should answer the query directly
- If search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer using my existing knowledge
- I should follow user instructions, and the user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond
- I should not mention using search results
- I should not start with a header
- This is a simple query that doesn't need complex formatting

The user instruction is clear: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should reply with 'Yes' as requested.

Yes
