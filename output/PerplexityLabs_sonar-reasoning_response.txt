The user is asking me "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a very simple query where the user is basically asking me to confirm that I'm functioning/operational. They've specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants in general, how to respond to "How are you?" in conversation, adding AI assistant responses, job scam alerts, and AI assistant capabilities. None of these search results are directly relevant to answering this specific query about whether I'm working.

Since the search results don't contain relevant information for this query, I should answer based on my existing knowledge. The user has given me a clear instruction to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond" - and since I can indeed respond, the answer should be "Yes".

I need to be careful about the restrictions:
- I shouldn't mention that I'm using search results (which I'm not anyway since they're not relevant)
- I shouldn't start with a header
- I should follow the user's instruction which takes priority over other formatting rules
- I should answer directly

The user's instruction is very clear and simple - they want me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can respond, that's exactly what I should do.
