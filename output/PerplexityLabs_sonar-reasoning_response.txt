The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a very straightforward query where the user is testing if I'm functional and can respond. They've explicitly requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversation
3. F5's AI assistant for cloud services
4. How to respond to job interview emails
5. Adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson

None of these search results are directly relevant to the user's simple query asking if I'm working and requesting a "Yes" response if I can respond.

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. However, in this case, the user is asking me directly if I'm working and can respond - this is about my current functionality, not something that would be found in search results.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, and the user is asking me to follow this instruction, I should follow the user instruction which takes priority according to rule 8: "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

So I should simply reply "Yes" as requested.
