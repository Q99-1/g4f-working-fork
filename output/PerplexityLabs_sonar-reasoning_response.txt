The user is asking me a simple question - "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This appears to be a straightforward test query to see if I'm functioning and can respond.

Looking at the search results:
- [1] is about AI assistants in general and their capabilities
- [2] is about how to respond to "How are you?" 
- [3] is about ChatGPT capabilities
- [4] is about job scams via text
- [5] is about AI Assistant capabilities

None of these search results are particularly relevant to answering this direct question. The user is asking me to confirm that I'm working by replying with "Yes" if I can respond.

Following the guidelines:
- I should answer directly
- If search results are unhelpful (which they are in this case), I should answer using my existing knowledge
- I should not mention that I'm using search results
- The user specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction
