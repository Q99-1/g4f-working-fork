The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query that doesn't require me to use the search results much, since it's a direct question about my functionality. 

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. How AI assistants work and their capabilities
2. How to respond to "How are you" in conversations (seems to be about human conversations)
3. AI assistant technologies 
4. Warning about ignoring "hi, how are you" text messages from strangers
5. IBM documentation about AI assistant responses

The user is asking me directly if I'm working and wants a specific response format. Since I can respond, I should say "Yes" as requested. This is straightforward and doesn't need extensive formatting or citations from the search results.

I should be direct and concise here since this is a simple functionality check.

Yes, I am working and can respond to your queries. I'm fully operational and ready to help you with any questions or tasks you may have.
