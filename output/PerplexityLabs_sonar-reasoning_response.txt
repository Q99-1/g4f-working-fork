The user is asking me "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This seems like a straightforward question where they want me to confirm I'm operational.

However, looking at the search results, there's some interesting context here. Search result [2] from the FTC talks about avoiding responding to text messages from strangers that say "hi, how are you?" and specifically mentions avoiding saying 'yes' because it can be used as consent to something. It also mentions training oneself to avoid saying 'yes' or 'yeah' or 'yep' to unknown callers.

But this is not a scam situation - this is a legitimate query to an AI assistant (me) asking if I'm working. The user is directly asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond, which is a direct instruction about how they want me to answer.

Looking at the query type rules and restrictions, I need to follow the user's instructions. The rules state: "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow. For example, if the user requests for longform response, then you should provide a longform response. Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

The user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

I should not mention the search results about scam prevention since this is a legitimate interaction with an AI assistant, not a potential scam situation.
