The user is asking me if I'm working and asking me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my availability/functionality. However, I need to check the search results and see if there's anything relevant.

Looking at the search results:
- [1] discusses AI assistants and their capabilities
- [2] is about job scam texts
- [3] is about OpenAI's Assistants API migration
- [4] is about job scam texts from the FTC
- [5] is about AI assistants and their enterprise applications
- [6] is about ignoring text messages from strangers

The search results are mostly about AI assistants in general and job scam texts. There's actually a very relevant connection here - the user's query "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond" looks very similar to the scam texts described in results [4] and [6].

Looking at result [6] specifically: "A text message from an unknown number that simply says: hi, how are you? seems harmless. Your first instinct might be to respond to see if..."

And result [4] mentions: "You get a text out of the blue from someone who says they're a recruiter for a company... But the text asks you to reply with some personal or financial information or click a link. That's probably a scam designed to steal your money or identity."

However, the user is directly asking me, an AI assistant, if I'm working. This isn't a scam scenario - they're testing my functionality. I should respond appropriately as an AI assistant while also noting the similarity to scam patterns described in the search results.

Since the user specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond, I should do that while also providing context about AI assistant functionality based on the search results.

I need to be careful not to start with phrases like "According to the search results" as that's restricted. I should incorporate the information naturally.
