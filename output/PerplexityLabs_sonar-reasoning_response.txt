The user is asking me a simple greeting question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants, job scams via text, Google search issues, Microsoft Teams AI assistant, and a website about not just saying "hello" in chat. None of these directly address the user's simple query.

The search results don't contain information that would help me answer this specific query. The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

According to my instructions, if the search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer the query to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge. The user has given me a specific instruction to reply with "Yes" if I can respond, and I can indeed respond.

I should follow the user's instruction
