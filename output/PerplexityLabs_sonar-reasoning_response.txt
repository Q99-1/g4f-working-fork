The user is asking a very simple greeting/status check question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query that just wants to know if I'm operational. The user specifically requests that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, how they work, capabilities, etc. However, this query is not really about understanding AI assistants in depth - it's just a simple status check.

According to the restrictions:
- I should not start with a header
- I should answer directly
- I should not use phrases like "According to the search results" etc.
- I should answer in the same language as the query (English)

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a clear user instruction that I should follow as per point 8 in the guidelines: "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow... Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

Since this is such a simple query and the user has given specific instructions on how to respond, I should simply respond with "Yes" as requested. The search results are not really relevant to this simple status check question.
