The user is asking if I am working, and specifically requesting that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple test query to check if I'm functional. 

Looking at the search results provided, they contain information about AI assistants in general, how they work, and some technical documentation, but none of this is relevant to the simple question being asked. The user is directly asking me if I'm working and wants a specific response format.

Since this is a direct question to me about my functionality, and the user has specifically requested I respond with "Yes" if I can respond, I should simply follow their instruction. The search results don't contain any relevant information for this query, so I'll answer based on my ability to respond to the user.

The user instruction is clear: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should reply with "Yes" as requested.

I need to be careful about the restrictions - I shouldn't mention using search results, and I should answer directly. The user has given a specific instruction about how to respond, which takes priority according to the guidelines.
