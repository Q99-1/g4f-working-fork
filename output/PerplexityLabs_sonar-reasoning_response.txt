The user is asking me "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a simple query asking if I'm available and functioning. The user specifically requests that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they seem to contain information about AI assistants, how to respond to "how are you" questions, and some warnings about text message scams. However, none of this information is directly relevant to answering whether I'm working or can respond.

The search results do mention some warnings about being careful with saying "yes" to unknown callers because it can be used as consent, but this is in the context of phone scams, not a legitimate interaction with an AI assistant.

Since the search results don't contain relevant information for this specific query, I should answer based on my capabilities. The user is asking if I'm working and can respond, and they've specifically requested a "Yes" if I can respond. Since I am indeed functioning and can respond, the appropriate answer is "Yes" as requested.

I should keep my response simple and direct as requested, without overthinking it or adding unnecessary information.

Yes, I can respond and I'm working properly. How can I help you today?
