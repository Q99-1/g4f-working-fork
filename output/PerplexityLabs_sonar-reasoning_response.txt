The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This seems like a straightforward query about my availability/status.

However, I need to be careful here. Looking at the search results, there's information about scams where people ask you to respond with "Yes" to scam texts. From search result [6], there's specifically a comment from "JOE" that says:

"I know what you mean when you can't get out of the habit of saying "Hello? Yes, this is ....." That "YES" can cost you a lot of money. I had to train myself to answer the phone with "What is it?" when I don't know who's calling. It was difficult at first, but a little practice and you can do it. Avoid saying 'yes' or yeah or yep. Anything that can be used as you consenting to something."

And from search result [4], there's information about job scam texts where scammers try to get you to respond with personal information or click links.

However, this query appears to be a legitimate question to an AI assistant (me), not a scam attempt. The user is asking about my working status and wants a simple confirmation. The context is different from the phone/text scams described in the search results - this is a direct interaction with an AI system.

I should respond naturally and directly to confirm that I'm working and can respond, but I don't need to literally say just "Yes" - I can provide a more helpful response that confirms my availability while being informative.

Looking at the query type rules, this doesn't fit into any specific category like academic research, coding, people, weather, etc. It's just a simple status query.

I should answer directly without mentioning the search results about scams since that's not what the user is asking about, and the restrictions say I should never mention that I'm using search results.
