Okay, the user asked, "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Let me start by understanding the query. They want a simple 'Yes' if I'm functional.

First, looking at the search results provided. The first few results talk about AI assistants, their capabilities, and how they process language. For example, result [1] mentions that AI assistants use NLP and ML to understand inputs and generate responses. Result [3] and [5] also confirm that AI assistants can handle various queries and provide context-aware answers.

But the user specifically wants a 'Yes' as a reply. So, even though the search results explain the functioning of AI assistants, the actual response here should be brief. The user isn't asking for an explanation; they just want a confirmation of my functionality.

I need to check if there's any instruction in the search results that might affect this response. Result [2] talks about responding to "How are you?"
