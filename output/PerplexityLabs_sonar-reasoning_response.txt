The user is asking if I am working and requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query to check if I'm functional. The search results provided don't seem relevant to this direct question - they contain information about AI assistants in general, how to respond to job offers, and other unrelated topics.

According to the instructions, I should follow user instructions and they take priority over other formatting rules. The user specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should simply answer with 'Yes' as requested.

I should not mention that I'm using search results or that the search results are not relevant. I should just answer directly and simply as requested.

Yes
