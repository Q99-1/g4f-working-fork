The user is asking me a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

Looking at the search results, I can see that several of them discuss scams related to getting people to say "yes" on the phone or via text. Particularly search result [2] discusses the "Say Yes" scam where scammers try to get people to say "yes" which they then record and use for fraudulent purposes. Search result [6] also discusses job-related text scams.

However, I need to be careful here. The user is asking me directly if I'm working and to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This appears to be a legitimate query to me as an AI assistant, not a scam attempt. The user is simply trying to confirm that I'm functioning and can respond to their query.

The search results are about phone/text scams targeting humans, not about interactions with AI assistants. The context here is different - this is a direct interaction with an AI system through a proper interface, not an unsolicited call or text.

I should respond naturally and directly to confirm that I am working and can respond. I don't need to be overly suspicious of this straightforward question
