The user is asking if I'm working, and specifically requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple test query to see if I'm functional and can respond. They've given me a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

According to the guidelines, I should follow user instructions, and the user has specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can indeed respond, I should reply with 'Yes'.

The search results provided are about AI assistants, job offers, and other topics, but they're not really relevant to this simple query. The user just wants to know if I'm working and has asked for a specific response format.

I should keep this simple and direct, following their instruction.

Yes
