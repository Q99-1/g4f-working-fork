The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very simple query asking about my operational status. The search results provided don't seem to be relevant to this question - they contain information about AI assistants in general, how to respond to "How are you?" in conversation, and some Microsoft Teams documentation.

Looking at the instructions, I need to:
1. Answer the query directly
2. Follow user instructions (they specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond)
3. Not mention using search results
4. The search results aren't relevant to this simple operational query anyway

Since I can respond and the user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, I should simply answer "Yes" as requested.

This falls under the restriction that I should follow user instructions, and the user instruction here takes priority over other formatting rules as stated in point 8 of the main instructions.

Yes
