The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very simple test query to see if I'm functional and responsive.

Looking at the search results provided, they are about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to reply to job offers
3. What AI assistants are (Salesforce)
4. How to respond to "How are you?" 
5. F5's AI assistant introduction

None of these search results are relevant to answering the user's simple query about whether I'm working. The search results don't provide any information that would help answer this specific question.

According to the guidelines, if the search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer the query to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge. In this case, the user is simply testing if I can respond, and they've explicitly requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

This is a straightforward request - they want confirmation that I'm functional and can provide responses. Since I can indeed respond to their query, the appropriate answer is simply "Yes" as they requested.

I should not mention search results or cite anything since the search results are not helpful for this query. I should just give the direct, simple answer they requested.

Yes
