The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This seems like a straightforward query where the user wants to know if I'm functional and can respond. They specifically ask me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results:
- The search results are mostly about AI assistants in general, how to respond to "how are you" questions, and some technical documentation about AI assistant responses
- There's one search result about why it's not rude to ignore "hi, how are you?" text messages from strangers, which mentions being cautious about saying "yes" because it can be used as consent

However, this is a legitimate interaction where the user is simply testing if I'm working/responsive. The user is directly asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond, which is exactly what they want me to do.

The search results don't really contain information that directly answers this query - this is more of a direct interaction test rather than something that needs research. The user wants a simple confirmation that I'm working.

Given the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results, and I should answer directly. Since this is a simple functional test, I should just respond as requested.

Looking at the query type rules, this doesn't fall into any specific category like academic research, coding, people, weather, etc. It's just a simple interaction test.

The user specifically requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond, so that's what I should do.
