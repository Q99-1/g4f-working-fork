The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a very straightforward query where the user is testing if I'm functioning and asking for a specific response format. They want me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results:
1. The first result is about AI assistants and their capabilities from Salesforce
2. The second is about how to respond to "How are you?" from YouTube
3. The third is about AI Assistant capabilities from WorkWithPlus
4. The fourth is about job scam texts from FTC
5. The fifth is about ChatGPT capabilities from OpenAI

These search results don't really contain information relevant to answering this specific query. The user is simply asking if I'm working and wants a 'Yes' response if I can respond.

According to the guidelines, if the search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer the query to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge. The search results here don't provide any relevant information for this simple query.

The user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow their instruction and simply answer 'Yes' since I am indeed able to respond.

I should not mention search results or sources, and I should follow the user
