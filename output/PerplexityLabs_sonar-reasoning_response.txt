This is a simple query asking if I'm working and specifically requesting a response of 'Yes' if I can respond. The user wants to know if I'm operational and has given me specific instructions on how to respond.

Looking at the search results provided:
- They contain information about AI assistants, how they work, and some unrelated content about responding to text messages and scams
- The search results are not particularly relevant to answering this specific query about whether I'm working
- The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond"

According to the guidelines:
- I should follow user instructions (point 8 says "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow... Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here")
- I should not mention search results or cite sources when they're not helpful
- The search results don't contain relevant information for this simple operational query

The user is simply testing if I'm operational and has requested a specific response format. Since I can respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

Yes
