The user is asking a simple question to test if I'm working and can respond. They specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't require analysis of the search results, as it's just asking about my current functionality.

Looking at the restrictions, I should:
1. Not include URLs or links
2. Not begin with a header
3. Answer directly
4. Not use phrases like "According to the search results" 
5. Answer in the same language as the query (English)

The user gave a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction while being helpful.

Since this is a simple functionality test, I don't need to cite any search results or provide elaborate formatting. A simple, direct response is appropriate here.

Yes
