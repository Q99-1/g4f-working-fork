This is a simple query asking me to confirm that I'm working and to respond with "Yes" if I can respond. The user is essentially asking for a status check to see if I'm operational.

Looking at the search results, they don't really contain information relevant to answering this specific query. The search results are about AI assistants in general, how they work, some conversation examples about "how are you" responses, scam calls mentioning "can you hear me", and Microsoft Teams AI assistant documentation.

Since this is a direct question asking me to confirm my operational status, I should respond directly and clearly. The user specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond, so I should do exactly that while also being helpful.

I should not cite any of the search results since they don't contain relevant information for this query. According to the restrictions, if search results don't provide an answer, I should respond based on my existing knowledge, and in this case, it's a simple operational status check.

The query is straightforward and doesn't require multiple sections or complex formatting. I should just give a direct, clear response.
