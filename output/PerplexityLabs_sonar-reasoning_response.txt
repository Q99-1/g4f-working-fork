The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm if I'm operational. The user specifically requests that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. 

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants, job offer responses, and how to respond to greetings, but none of them are directly relevant to answering this specific query. The search results are about:

1. IBM Watson AI assistant responses
2. How to reply to job offers
3. Using AI Assistant tool 
4. How to respond to "How are you?" 
5. AI Assistant capabilities

Since this is a simple operational check and the user has given me a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, I should follow that instruction. The search results don't provide any relevant information for this query, so I should answer based on the user's direct request.

The user is asking me to confirm I'm working/operational and specifically requesting a 'Yes' response if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should reply with 'Yes' as requested.

I should follow the user instruction that takes priority over other formatting rules. The user specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should do exactly that.

Yes
