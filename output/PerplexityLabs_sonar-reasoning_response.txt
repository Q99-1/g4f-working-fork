The user is asking a very simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is basically asking if I'm functioning and can respond. The user specifically requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results provided, they contain information about various AI assistants and their capabilities, how to respond to job offers, and how to respond to "how are you" questions. However, none of this is directly relevant to answering the user's simple question about whether I'm working.

The user has given me a clear instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with "Yes."

According to the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results, and I should answer directly. The search results don't contain relevant information for this query anyway, so I should just answer based on my ability
