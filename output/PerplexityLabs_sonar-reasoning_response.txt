The user is asking me a simple question to test if I'm working and specifically requests that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't require complex formatting or the use of search results.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. IBM Watson AI assistant responses
2. How to answer "How are you?" questions
3. AI assistant capabilities 
4. YouTube video about responding to "How are you?"
5. Microsoft Teams AI assistant

None of these search results are relevant to the user's simple query asking if I'm working. The user just wants to know if I can respond, and they've specifically requested a "Yes" response if I can.

According to the guidelines, if search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer the query to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge. In this case, the search results don't help answer whether I'm working or not - that's something I need to answer directly.

The user has given a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Following user instructions takes priority over other formatting rules as stated in point 8 of the guidelines.

I should simply respond with "Yes" as requested, since I can indeed respond to their query.
