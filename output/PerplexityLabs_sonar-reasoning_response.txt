The user is asking me a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query where the user wants to know if I'm functioning and able to respond. They've specifically requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants in general, how they work, and some unrelated content about responding to "how are you" messages and text message etiquette. None of these search results are directly relevant to answering the user's specific question about whether I'm working and can respond.

Since the search results don't contain relevant information for this specific query, I should answer based on my existing knowledge and the user's specific instruction. The user has explicitly asked me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction directly.

This is a simple, direct query that doesn't require complex formatting, headers, or detailed explanations. The user just wants confirmation that I'm working.
