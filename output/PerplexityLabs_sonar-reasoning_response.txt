The user is asking me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking me to confirm that I'm functioning. They're specifically requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and their capabilities, but this query is very straightforward - it's just asking me to confirm I'm working by responding with 'Yes'.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can indeed respond, I should follow this instruction exactly as requested.

I need to be careful not to use any of the banned phrases like "Based on the search results" or similar. The search results aren't really relevant to this simple query anyway - this is just a basic functionality check.

Since I can respond, I should simply say "Yes" as requested.

Yes
