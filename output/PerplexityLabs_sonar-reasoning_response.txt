I'm receiving a query that says: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This appears to be a simple test query to check if I'm functioning properly and can respond. The instructions specifically ask me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results provided, they contain information about various AI assistants from different platforms (IBM Watson, Responsive, WorkWithPlus), but they don't seem to be directly relevant to answering this specific query. The query isn't asking for information about how AI assistants work or how to use them - it's simply checking if I'm operational.

Since I am functioning and able to process this query, the appropriate response according to the instructions is simply "Yes".

The search results contain information about:
1. IBM Watson's AI assistant responses
2. A YouTube video about responding to "How are you?"
3. Information about Responsive's AI Assistant
