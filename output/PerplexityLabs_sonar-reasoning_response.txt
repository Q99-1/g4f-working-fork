The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple test query to check if I'm operational. 

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. What is an AI assistant and how they work
2. How to respond to recruiter emails  
3. More information about AI assistants from Salesforce
4. How to respond to "How are you?" 
5. Assistant API vs Responses API differences

None of these search results are relevant to answering the user's simple question about whether I'm working. The user is asking for a direct response - they want me to say "Yes" if I can respond.

According to the restrictions, if the search results don't provide an answer, I should respond saying the information is not available. However, this is a direct question about my operational status, and the user has given me clear instructions on how to respond ("Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond").

The user instruction is: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a clear user instruction that I should follow according to rule 8: "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow. Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

Since I can respond (as evidenced by the fact that I'm responding), I should say "Yes" as requested.
