The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my operational status. The user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and their capabilities, as well as some information about how to respond to "How are you?" in conversation. However, this query is not really asking for information from the search results - it's asking me directly if I'm working/operational.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should follow this instruction. The search results don't really apply to this specific query about my operational status.

According to the guidelines, I should follow user instructions, and the user has specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This takes priority over other formatting rules.

The search results are not really relevant to this query, so I shouldn't force citations into my response. The query is asking about my current operational status, not about AI assistant capabilities in general.

Yes.
