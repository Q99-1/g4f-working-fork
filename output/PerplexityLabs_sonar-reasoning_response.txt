The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a very straightforward query that's asking me to confirm if I'm functioning and can respond. The user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and their capabilities, but this query is not really asking for detailed information about AI assistants - it's just a simple test to see if I'm working.

According to the restrictions:
- I should not start with a header
- I should answer directly
- I should not mention using search results
- I should follow user instructions (they asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond)

The user instruction is very clear: "Reply with 'Yes' if I can respond." Since I can respond, I should reply with 'Yes' as requested. This is a simple interaction check, not a complex query requiring detailed analysis of search results.

The search results are not relevant to this simple query, so I won't be citing them. The user is just checking if I'm working and has given me specific instructions on how to respond.

Yes
