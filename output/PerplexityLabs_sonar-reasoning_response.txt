The user is asking me if I'm working, and specifically requesting that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This seems like a simple test query to see if I'm functioning properly.

Looking at the search results, I don't see anything directly relevant to answering this question. The search results contain information about AI assistants in general, how to respond to "how are you" greetings, and some information about responding to unknown text messages.

The restriction #8 mentions that if the search results don't provide an answer, I should respond by saying the information is not available. However, this query isn't really asking for information that would be in search results - it's a direct question about my current operational status.

The user is asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond, which is a simple request. Since I can respond (evidenced by the fact that I'm formulating this response), I should follow their instruction and respond with "Yes".

This seems like a straightforward operational check rather than a complex query requiring detailed research from the search results. The search results don't contain relevant information about AI assistant operational status, so I should answer based on my ability to respond, which is what they're asking about.

Yes
