The user is asking a simple question to test if I'm working/functional. They specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very straightforward query that doesn't require complex analysis or formatting. The search results provided are about AI assistant capabilities and responses, but they're not directly relevant to answering this simple question.

Since this is a direct, simple question asking for confirmation of my functionality, and the user has specifically requested a 'Yes' response format, I should simply respond with 'Yes' as requested.

The search results are about various AI assistant capabilities but don't directly address this query. I should answer based on my ability to respond, which I clearly can since I'm formulating this response.

Yes
