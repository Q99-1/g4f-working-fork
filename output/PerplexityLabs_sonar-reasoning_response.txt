The user is asking me if I'm working and asking me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This seems like a simple query to check if I'm available and functioning. 

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to respond to "How are you?" questions in conversation
3. IBM documentation about AI assistant responses
4. FTC consumer alert about ignoring texts from strangers
5. Documentation about using an AI Assistant tool

The search results don't directly relate to the user's query about whether I'm working. The user is simply checking if I can respond, and they've specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

According to the restrictions, I should follow user instructions, and the user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should reply with 'Yes' as requested.

I should not cite the search results since they don't contain information relevant to answering whether I'm working or can respond. The search results are about AI assistants in general, conversation responses, and documentation for various AI tools, but none directly address the user's specific query.

The user instruction is clear and takes priority over other formatting rules as stated in rule 8 of the instructions.
