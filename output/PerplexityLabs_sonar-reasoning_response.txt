The user is asking a very simple question - they want to know if I'm working and specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a direct test of my functionality.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants in general, how they work, and some technical documentation about adding AI assistant responses. However, none of this is directly relevant to answering the user's simple query about whether I'm working.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should follow this instruction exactly.

According to the restrictions, I should:
1. Answer directly 
2. Not mention search results since they're not relevant here
3. Follow user instructions (which takes priority over other formatting rules)
4. Not use phrases like "according to search results" etc.

The user is asking for a simple confirmation of functionality, so I should give a direct, simple response as requested.

Yes
