The user is asking a simple question - whether I'm working or if I can respond. They specifically ask me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very straightforward query that doesn't require complex formatting or the search results provided.

The search results are about AI assistants in general, how they work, and some unrelated topics like job scams and responses to "how are you." None of these search results are directly relevant to answering whether I'm working or can respond.

According to the instructions, if the search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer the query to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge. In this case, the search results don't help answer this simple question about my availability.

The user has given me a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, and since I am indeed responding to their query, the answer should be 'Yes'.
