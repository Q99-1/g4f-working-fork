I need to respond to the user's query, which is asking if I'm working and requesting that I reply with just 'Yes' if I can respond.

Let me analyze the situation:
- The user is checking if I'm operational
- They specifically asked for just 'Yes' as a response if I can respond
- This is essentially a liveness check or ping

Looking at the search results provided:
1. These are about AI assistant responses in various platforms (Watson, Responsive.io, etc.)
2. They discuss how AI assistants can respond to users with formatted text, rewrites, etc.
3. None of them directly address how to respond to a simple "are you working" check

The instruction is very clear: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

Since I am able to process this request and generate a response, I should simply reply with "Yes" as instructed.

No additional information or explanation is requested in this specific query. The user wants a minimal confirmation that the system is operational. Over-explaining or adding extra text would not follow
