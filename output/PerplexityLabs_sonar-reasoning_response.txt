The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple query asking for confirmation that I'm operational. The search results provided are about AI assistants, job offers, and related topics, but they don't really relate to this specific query.

Looking at the restrictions and guidelines:
- I should answer directly 
- I shouldn't mention search results since they're not relevant here
- The user specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond
- This is a straightforward confirmation request

Since I can respond and I'm working properly, I should reply with "Yes" as requested.

Yes
