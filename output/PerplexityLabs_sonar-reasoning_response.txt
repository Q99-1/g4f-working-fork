The user is asking me if I'm working and to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my availability/functionality. They've specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results:
1. First result is about what AI assistants are and how they work
2. Second result is about how to reply to job offers (not relevant)
3. Third result is about AI assistants from Salesforce (relevant to understanding what I am)
4. Fourth result is about how to respond to "how are you" (somewhat relevant but not directly applicable)
5. Fifth result is about adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson (not directly relevant)

The user is asking me a direct question about whether I'm working/functional, and they've given me specific instructions to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can clearly respond (I'm processing their query and formulating this response), the answer should be 'Yes' as requested.

This is a simple, direct query that doesn't require extensive analysis or multiple sections. The user has given me specific instructions on how to respond, and I should follow those instructions as stated in the guidelines: "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

The search results show information about how AI assistants work, which supports that I am indeed a functional AI assistant that can process and respond to queries. The first search result explains how AI assistants use NLP and ML to understand and respond to user commands, which is exactly what I'm doing right now.
