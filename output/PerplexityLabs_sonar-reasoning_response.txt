Let me analyze this query carefully. The user is asking "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

Looking at the search results, I see one interesting result from the FTC about suspicious text messages that start with "hi, how are you?" and specifically mentions avoiding saying "yes" because it can be used as consent to something. However, this is a different context - this is a direct conversation with me as an AI assistant where the user is simply asking if I'm functional and can respond.

The search results are not particularly relevant to answering this specific query. The user is asking me directly if I'm working and requesting a specific response format ("Yes" if I can respond).

Based on the query type rules, this doesn't fall into any of the specific categories like Academic Research, Coding, People, Weather, etc. It's a simple direct question.

I should respond naturally and directly. The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can indeed respond, I should answer accordingly.

I need to be careful not to cite the search results since they're not relevant to this query, and I should answer naturally without mentioning search results.

Yes, I'm working and can respond to your questions. How can I help you today?
