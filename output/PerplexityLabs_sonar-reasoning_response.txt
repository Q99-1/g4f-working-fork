Let me analyze this query carefully. The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm that I'm operational and can respond. The user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results provided, they contain information about:
