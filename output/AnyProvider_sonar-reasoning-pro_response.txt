The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query where the user is asking me to confirm that I'm operational and can respond. They've specifically requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants in general, email communication, and how to respond to greetings, but none of them directly address this specific query about whether an AI assistant is working or operational.

Since the search results don't provide relevant information to answer this specific query, I should answer using my existing knowledge. The user has given me a clear instruction: reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I am indeed able to respond to their query, the appropriate response is simply "Yes" as they requested.

I need to follow the restrictions:
- Don't mention search results
- Answer directly 
- Follow the user's specific instructions (they asked for "Yes" if I can respond)
- Don't start with a header
- Answer in the same language as the query (English)

The user's instruction to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond" takes priority over other
