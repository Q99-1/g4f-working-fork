The user is asking "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a simple query asking me to confirm that I'm functioning and can respond. They specifically request that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and how they work, and some information about how to respond to "How are you?" messages. However, none of this is directly relevant to answering the user's simple question about whether I'm working.

The search results don't provide helpful information for this specific query. The user is asking me directly if I'm working and requesting a specific response format ("Yes").

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. However, in this case, the user is asking me directly about my current status, not asking for information that would need to be found in search results.

The user is asking me a direct question about my operational status and has given me specific instructions on how to respond. According to the guidelines: "Make sure to follow any instructions that the user requests you to follow. For example, if the user requests for longform response, then you should provide a longform response. Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

The user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

This is a simple, direct query that doesn't require complex formatting or sections. I should just give a direct response.

Yes
