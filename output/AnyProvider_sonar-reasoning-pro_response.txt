The user is asking me to check if I'm working and to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very simple query to test if I'm functional. The search results provided are about AI assistants and how to respond to job offers and greetings, but they're not really relevant to this specific query.

Since this is a direct question asking me to confirm I'm working and to respond with "Yes" if I can respond, and I am indeed able to respond, I should simply answer "Yes" as requested.

The user is giving me a specific instruction on how to respond - to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Following user instructions takes priority over other formatting rules, so I should just give a simple "Yes" response.

I don't need to cite any of the search results since they're not relevant to answering this simple functionality test question.

Yes
