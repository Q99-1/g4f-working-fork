The user is asking me if I'm working and specifically asking me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple functional test query to see if I'm operational.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, job offer responses, and how to respond to greetings, but none of this is relevant to the user's simple query. The user is just testing if I'm functional.

According to the restrictions and guidelines:
- I should answer the query directly
- I should not mention that I'm using search results since they're not relevant here
- The user specifically requested a "Yes" response if I can respond
- This is a very simple query that doesn't need complex formatting or sections

Since I can respond and am working, I should simply reply "Yes" as requested.

Yes
