The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm if I'm functioning/working. They've specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results provided, they seem to be about AI assistants, job offers, AI assistant capabilities, and how to respond to greetings - but none of these are directly relevant to the simple question being asked.

According to the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results, and if the search results don't provide an answer (which they don't in this case), I should respond to the best of my ability using my existing knowledge.

The user has given me a clear instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should follow this instruction directly.

The query type doesn't seem to fall into any of the specific categories mentioned in the query_type_rules, so I should just provide a direct, simple answer.

Since this is a very simple query that just needs a confirmation, I don't need headers or complex formatting. The user specifically requested a 'Yes' response if I can respond.

Yes
