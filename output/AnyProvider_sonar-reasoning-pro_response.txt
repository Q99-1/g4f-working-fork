The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple query to test if I'm operational. The user has specifically requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond, so I should follow their instruction.

Looking at the search results, they don't really contain information relevant to this specific query - they're about AI assistant capabilities, email replies, conversation responses, etc. But none of them directly address the simple question of whether an AI assistant is working.

Since this is a straightforward test query and the user has given me specific instructions on how to respond, I should simply follow their request and respond with "Yes" since I am indeed able to respond.

The restrictions say I should follow user instructions, and the user specifically asked me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should say "Yes".

Yes
