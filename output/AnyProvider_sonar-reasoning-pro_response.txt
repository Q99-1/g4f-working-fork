The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple query to test if I'm functioning. The search results provided are about AI assistants in general, but they're not directly relevant to this specific question. 

Since I can respond to this query, I should answer "Yes" as requested. This is a straightforward response that doesn't require citations from the search results since they don't contain information specifically about my operational status.

The user has given me a specific instruction to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond" - so I should follow that instruction precisely. According to the rules, "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

This is a simple query that doesn't need headers, complex formatting, or multiple sections. A direct, simple response is appropriate.

Yes
