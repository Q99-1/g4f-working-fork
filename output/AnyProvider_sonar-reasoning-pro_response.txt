The user is asking a very simple question "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This seems like they're testing if I'm functioning and specifically requesting a "Yes" response if I can respond.

However, looking at the search results, there's some interesting context here. Search result [2] is about scam text messages and specifically mentions being cautious about saying "yes" because scammers can use recorded "yes" responses as consent for various things.

Let me look at the restrictions:
- I should not include phrases like "According to the search results" or "Based on the search results"
- I should answer directly
- I should cite relevant search results where appropriate

The query is asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple functionality test. While the search results contain information about AI assistants and scam warnings, the user's request is straightforward - they want to know if I'm working and specifically asked for a "Yes" response.

Given that this is a direct query to an AI assistant (me) and not a suspicious text from an unknown number, the scam warning context doesn't really apply here. The user is interacting with me directly through a known platform.

I should respond simply and directly as requested, since I am indeed working and can respond.

Yes, I am working and can respond to your queries. I'm fully operational and ready to assist you with any questions or tasks you may have.
