The user is asking me a very simple query - they want to know if I'm working and they specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward question that doesn't require the search results at all. The search results contain information about:

1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversation
3. Adding AI assistant responses in some IBM system
4. Warning about text scams that ask "hi, how are you?"
5. Using an AI Assistant tool

None of these search results are relevant to answering the user's simple question about whether I'm working/can respond. Since the search results are not helpful for this query, I should answer using my existing knowledge as instructed.

The user specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can indeed respond, the answer should be 'Yes'. This is a very simple query that doesn't need headers, formatting, or elaborate explanations. I should just give a direct, concise answer.

I need to be careful about the restrictions:
- Don't mention using search results
- Don't start with a header
- Answer directly
- Follow user instructions (they asked for 'Yes' if I can respond)

Since I can respond, the answer is simply 'Yes'.

Yes
