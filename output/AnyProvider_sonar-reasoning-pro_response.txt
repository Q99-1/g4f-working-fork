The user is asking me if I'm working, and specifically wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query to check if I'm functional/operational.

Let me check the search results to see if there's any relevant information, but this seems like a straightforward question about my operational status rather than something that requires the search results.

Looking at the search results:
1. About AI assistants and how they work
2. A YouTube video about how to respond to "How are you?"
3. More about AI assistants and their functionality
4. About job scam texts
5. Introducing an AI assistant

The search results don't really contain information that's directly relevant to answering whether I'm working/operational. The user is asking for a simple confirmation that I can respond.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can indeed respond, I should follow this
