The user is asking a simple question - "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm if I'm operational. The user specifically requests that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. 

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and ways to say yes/no in English, but this information isn't directly relevant to answering this simple operational query. The user just wants confirmation that I'm working.

Based on the restrictions, I should not cite search results for this type of simple response, and I should answer directly. The user has given me a specific instruction to reply with "Yes" if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction.

This is not a complex query that needs sections or detailed formatting - it's a simple yes/no question with specific instructions on how to respond.

Yes
