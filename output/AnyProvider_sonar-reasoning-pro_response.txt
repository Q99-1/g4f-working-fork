The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a very straightforward query asking me to confirm if I'm operational/working. They specifically request me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. AI assistants and how they work (Salesforce article)
2. How to respond to "How are you?" (YouTube video transcript)
3. AI assistant capabilities (Fugo.ai article)

However, none of these search results are relevant to the specific query being asked. The user is simply asking if I'm working and wants a "Yes" response if I can respond.

According to the restrictions:
- If the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available
- But in this case, this is a direct question to me about my operational status, not something that would be found in search results

The user is asking me directly if I'm working and requesting a specific response format. This is not really a search-based query - it's a direct interaction query to test if I'm operational.
