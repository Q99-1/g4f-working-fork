This query is asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond. The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, there are some mentions about responding to "how are you" questions and some information about AI assistants, but nothing directly relevant to answering this specific query. There's also some content about scams where scammers try to get people to say "Yes" on phone calls, but this appears to be a legitimate query from a user asking me directly if I can respond.

The user is giving me a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I am functioning and can respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with "Yes". This is a simple, direct query that doesn't require citing search results since the search results don't contain relevant information for this specific question.

The user instruction says "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here." So I should follow their instruction to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

I should not cite any search results here since they don't contain information relevant to answering whether I'm working or can respond.
