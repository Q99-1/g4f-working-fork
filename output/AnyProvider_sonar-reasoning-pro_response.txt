The user is asking me if I'm working and specifically requests that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query about my availability/status.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and how to respond to greetings, but they don't directly relate to this specific query. The search results include:

1. Information about AI assistants and their capabilities
2. A video about how to respond to "How are you?" 
3. Information about F5's AI assistant
4. An FTC warning about responding to unknown text messages
5. IBM documentation about AI assistant responses

Since the search results don't provide a direct answer to the user's simple question about whether I'm working, I should answer based on my understanding. The user is asking if I can respond and wants a simple "Yes" if I can. Since I am functioning and can respond to their query, the appropriate answer is "Yes" as they requested.

I need to be careful about the restrictions - I shouldn't mention that I'm using search results, and I should answer directly. The user has given me a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction.

Yes
