The user is asking a simple question - "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a straightforward query asking if I'm functional and operational. 

Looking at the search results, they don't really contain information directly relevant to answering this question. The search results are about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work (Salesforce page)
2. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversation (YouTube video)
3. Adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson
4. Why it's not rude to ignore "hi, how are you?" text messages from strangers (FTC consumer alert)
5. Using AI Assistant in some responsive.io platform

None of these directly answer whether I'm working or functional. The search results are not helpful for this query, so I should answer based on my existing knowledge.

The user is asking me to respond with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple test of my functionality. Since I can process the query and formulate a response, the appropriate answer is "Yes" as requested.

I should note that I shouldn't mention using search results since they're not relevant, and I should follow the restriction about not mentioning search results anyway.

The user specifically requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond, so I should do exactly that.

Yes
