This is a simple query asking me if I'm working and to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. The user is essentially asking for confirmation that I'm operational and can provide responses.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. How AI assistants work
2. How to respond to "How are you?" questions 
3. Information about AI assistants from Salesforce
4. A consumer alert about ignoring "hi, how are you?" text messages from strangers
5. AI assistant capabilities

The search results don't directly answer the user's question about whether I'm working. The user wants a simple "Yes" response if I can respond. Since I can clearly respond to this query, I should answer "Yes" as requested.

The user has given me a specific instruction to reply with "Yes" if I can respond, and according to the guidelines, following user instructions takes priority over other formatting rules. This is a simple, direct query that doesn't require extensive analysis or formatting.

I should not cite any of the search results since they don't relate to the user's simple question about my operational status.
