The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This seems like a straightforward query asking about my availability/functionality. 

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. How AI assistants work
2. Job scam text messages 
3. AI assistant capabilities
4. Google search issues
5. AI assistant work capabilities
6. Text message scams

The search results don't directly relate to the user's simple question about whether I'm working. The user is asking for a simple confirmation that I can respond, and they've specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

However, I need to be careful here. Looking at search result [6], it mentions text scams that start with simple greetings like "Hello" or "Hi, How are you?" and warns that responding to such messages can be dangerous. Search result [2] also discusses job scam texts.

But in this context, the user is directly asking me (Perplexity) if I'm working, and this appears to be a legitimate interaction within the Perplexity platform, not a random text message scam. The user is asking for confirmation of my functionality.

Given the user's specific instruction to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond," and since I can indeed respond and am functioning, I should follow their instruction and respond with "Yes"
