The user is asking a very simple question - they want to know if I'm working and they've specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward test query to see if I'm operational.

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants, job scams via text messages, and chat response preparation tools. However, none of these search results are relevant to answering the user's simple question about whether I'm working.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

According to the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results, and I should answer naturally. Since the search results don't provide relevant information for this query, I should answer based on my ability to respond, which I clearly can do.

The user's instruction takes priority over other formatting rules, so I should simply respond with 'Yes' as requested.

Yes
