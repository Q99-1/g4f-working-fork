The user is asking if I'm working and they want a simple "Yes" response if I can respond. This is a straightforward query testing if I'm operational.

Looking at the search results, they're about AI assistants and how to respond to "How are you?" type questions, but the user's query is specifically asking for a "Yes" response if I can respond.

Since I can respond and I'm working, I should simply answer "Yes" as requested. The search results don't really apply to this specific query - the user is just testing if I'm operational.

The user gave a very clear instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should follow their instruction exactly.

Yes
