The user is asking me a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm if I'm operational. The user specifically requests that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they are about AI assistants and how they work, which is not directly relevant to this simple greeting/status check query. The search results discuss AI assistant capabilities, how they process language, and various features, but none of this information is needed to answer the user's direct question.

Since this is a simple status check, I should follow the user's instruction and reply with "Yes" as requested. I don't need to use the search results for this response since they don't contain relevant information for this specific query, and the user has given me clear instructions on how to respond.

The user is asking for a very simple confirmation, so I should keep my response concise and follow their specific instruction to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Yes
