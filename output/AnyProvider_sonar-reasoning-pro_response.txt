The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This seems like a simple query to test if I'm functioning properly. They want a very specific response format.

Looking at the search results, they're about AI assistant responses and how to format responses in various systems, and also about how to respond to "How are you?" in English conversation. But the user's query is quite specific - they want me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Since I can clearly respond to this query, and they've given me a specific instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, I should follow that instruction. The search results don't really apply to this specific query.

According to the restrictions, I should follow user instructions, and the user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This takes priority over other formatting rules.

Yes
