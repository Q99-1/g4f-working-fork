This is a straightforward query asking if I am working, and the user specifically requests me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This seems like a simple test or verification query.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to respond to "How are you?" as a greeting
3. Adding AI assistant responses in systems
4. Warning about responding to unknown text messages saying "hi, how are you?"
5. Using AI Assistant features

None of these search results are directly relevant to answering whether I am working or can respond. The search results don't contain information that helps answer this specific query.

Since the search results are not helpful for this query, I should answer based on my existing knowledge. The user is asking if I can respond and specifically requesting a 'Yes' if I can. Since I am clearly able to respond (as evidenced by me providing this response), the answer is straightforward.

I should follow the restriction about not mentioning search results and just provide a direct answer. The user has given me specific instructions to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction.

Looking at the query type rules, this doesn't fit into any specific category like academic research, coding, people, weather, etc. It's just a simple verification query.

I should not use any headers since this is a very simple query that doesn't need multiple sections. I should just provide a direct, brief response.

Yes, I can respond and I'm working properly. How can I help you today?
