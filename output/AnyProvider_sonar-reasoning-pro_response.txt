The user is asking if I'm working and requesting a simple "Yes" response if I can respond. This is a very straightforward query that doesn't require any complex analysis or detailed information from the search results. The user is essentially testing if I'm functional and responsive.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants in general and how they work, but they're not directly relevant to answering this simple query about whether I'm currently working/functional.

According to the guidelines:
- I should answer the query directly
- If search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer to the best of my ability using existing knowledge
- The search results here are about AI assistants in general but don't specifically address the user's simple test query
- The user specifically requested a "Yes" response if I can respond

This is a simple functionality test, so I should provide a direct, clear response as requested.

Yes.
