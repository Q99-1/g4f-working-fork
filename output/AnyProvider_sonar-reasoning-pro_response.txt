Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking, "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." They want a simple 'Yes' as an answer.

First, I need to confirm if I'm an AI assistant. The search results mention AI assistants' capabilities, like processing human language and responding [1][3][5]. Yep, that's me. 

The user wants a 'Yes'. But maybe they expect more? Wait, the query says to reply with 'Yes'. So I should just say 'Yes' and add a brief explanation. But the instructions say to cite sources. Hmm. Wait, the user's instruction says to reply with 'Yes' if able. So the answer is 'Yes', but I need to check if the search results support that. 

Looking at the results: [1] explains how AI assistants work, which confirms I can respond. [5] also mentions AI assistants can understand queries and respond. So citing these would make sense.
