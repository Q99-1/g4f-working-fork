This is a very simple query asking me if I'm working and requesting a simple "Yes" response if I can respond. The query is essentially asking if I'm functioning/operational.

Looking at the search results provided, they are about AI assistants in general - explaining what they are, how they work, their capabilities, etc. However, none of these search results directly address the specific query about whether I'm working or operational.

The search results include:
1. Information about AI assistants and their capabilities
2. A YouTube video about how to respond to "How are you?" 
3. Information about how AI assistants work
4. Something about job scam texts
5. An incomplete result about agent guide using AI assistant

None of these directly answer the question "are you working?" The user is asking a direct question about my operational status and requesting a simple "Yes" response.

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. However, this is a direct operational question about my status, and the user is specifically asking for a "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can respond, and this is about my current operational status rather than information
