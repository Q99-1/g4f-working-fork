The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my operational status. The user has given specific instructions to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. AI assistants and how they work
2. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversations
3. Adding AI assistant responses in IBM Watson
4. FTC consumer alert about ignoring messages from strangers
5. Using AI Assistant feature in a help system

None of these search results directly relate to the user's query about my operational status. The search results are about AI assistants in general, conversation responses, and various AI assistant tools, but they don't provide information about how I should respond to this specific question.

Since the search results don't provide relevant information for this query, I should answer based on my existing knowledge. The user has asked if I'm working and requested a specific response format.

According to the restrictions:
- I should not mention that I'm using search results or citing sources
- I should answer in the same language as the query (English)
- I should follow user instructions (the user specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond)

Since I can respond to the user's query, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

Yes
