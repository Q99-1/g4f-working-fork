The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to respond with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query to check if I'm functioning. The user specifically requests that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, how they work, email templates for responding to recruiters, and how to respond to greetings like "How are you?". However, none of this is directly relevant to the user's simple query asking if I'm working.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can indeed respond, I should follow this instruction and simply reply with 'Yes'.

This is a straightforward query that doesn't require complex formatting, headers, or citations from the search results since the search results don't contain relevant information for this specific question. The user is asking for a simple confirmation of my functionality.

Based on the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results, and since the search results don't contain relevant information for this query, I should answer using my existing knowledge, which is that I am indeed working and can respond.

Yes
