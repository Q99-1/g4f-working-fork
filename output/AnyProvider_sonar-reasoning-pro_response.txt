The user is asking me a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking if I'm functional and can respond. The user specifically requests that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

The search results provided are about AI assistants and how they respond, but they don't directly relate to the specific query being asked. The user is simply testing if I'm working and wants a 'Yes' response if I can respond.

Since I can respond and I'm working, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'. This is a simple, direct request that doesn't require complex formatting or multiple sections.

Looking at the restrictions and guidelines:
- I shouldn't start with a header
- I should answer directly 
- I shouldn't mention search results
- I should follow user instructions (they specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond)

The user instruction is clear: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should simply say "Yes."

Yes
