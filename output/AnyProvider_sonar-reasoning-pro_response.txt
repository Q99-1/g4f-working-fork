The user is asking me if I am working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very straightforward query that doesn't require me to use the search results at all. The search results are about AI assistants, UK ETA applications, and Microsoft Outlook email features, none of which are relevant to this simple question.

The user is specifically requesting that I respond with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I am clearly able to respond (I'm responding right now), I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

This is a simple query that doesn't need headers, formatting, or citations. I should just give a direct, simple answer as requested.

Yes
