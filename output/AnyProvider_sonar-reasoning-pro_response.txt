The user is asking a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward test query to see if I'm functional. The user is requesting a specific format - they want me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. AI assistants in general (Salesforce)
2. How to reply to job offers (Indeed)
3. Adding AI assistant responses (IBM)
4. How to respond to "How are you?" (YouTube)
5. Using AI Assistant (Help Center)

None of these search results are particularly relevant to answering the user's simple query about whether I'm working. The search results don't provide information that would help me answer this specific question.

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. However, this is a very simple query asking if I can respond, and the user is specifically asking for a "Yes" if I can respond. This seems like a basic functionality test.

Actually, let me reconsider. The user is asking if I'm working and to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a direct question about my current functionality. The search results don't contain information about whether I (Perplexity) am currently working or functional
