The user is asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking about my availability/status.

Looking at the search results:
1. Results about AI assistants and their capabilities 
2. A YouTube video about better ways to say yes and no in English
3. More about AI assistant capabilities
4. How to reply to job offers

The search results are not directly relevant to answering whether I'm working or available to respond. The second result does talk about ways to say yes and no, but that's more about language learning than directly answering the user's question.

This is a straightforward question about my availability. The user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I am indeed working and can respond, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

I should not mention the search results since they're not relevant to this simple availability question, and I should follow the user's specific instruction to reply with 'Yes'.

Yes
