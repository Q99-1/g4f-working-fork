The user is asking me a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm if I'm functioning and can respond. The user specifically requests that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they are about AI assistants in general - how they work, their capabilities, and some unrelated content about email responses and conversation. The search results don't directly address this specific query, but they do provide background information about how AI assistants function.

Since this is a direct request for a simple confirmation and the user has specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, I should follow their instruction. The user is essentially testing if I'm operational.

I need to be careful about the restrictions:
- I shouldn't start with a header
- I shouldn't mention that I'm using search results
- I should follow the user's instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond
- This seems to be a simple functional test, not requiring extensive formatting

The user's instruction is clear: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should reply with 'Yes' as requested.

Yes
