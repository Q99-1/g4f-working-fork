The user is asking me a direct question about whether I'm working and asks me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query that doesn't require me to use the search results extensively. The search results contain information about AI assistants and how they work, but they also include some warnings about scam texts that start with "hi, how are you?" messages.

Looking at the search results:
1. Information about AI assistants and how they work
2. A video about responding to "How are you?" 
3. IBM documentation about AI assistant responses
4. An FTC warning about ignoring "hi, how are you?" texts from strangers
5. Information about using an AI Assistant tool

The user's query is straightforward - they want to know if I'm working and can respond. Since I can clearly respond to their message, the answer should be "Yes" as they requested.

However, I need to be careful about the restrictions. One of the search results [4] mentions warnings about scam texts and even mentions avoiding saying "yes" to unknown callers because it can be used as consent. But in this context, the user is directly asking me if I can respond, and I'm an AI assistant, so this warning doesn't apply to our interaction.

The user specifically asked me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should do exactly that while maybe providing a bit more context about being ready to help.
