This is a very simple query asking if I am working and requesting a specific response format ("Yes" if I can respond). The user is essentially asking if I'm functional and able to respond.

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to reply to job offers
3. AI assistant capabilities 
4. Job offer scams via text
5. AI assistant capabilities documentation

None of these search results are directly relevant to answering the simple question "are you working?" The search results don't contain information about my specific status or functionality.

Since the search results are not helpful for this query, I should answer using my existing knowledge. The user is asking if I'm working/functional and requesting a "Yes" response if I can respond.

The query is very straightforward - they want to know if I'm operational and can respond. Since I can clearly respond to their message, the answer should be "Yes" as requested.

I should not mention that I'm using search results since they're not relevant, and I should just answer directly and naturally.

Yes
