The user is asking me to respond to a greeting and question about whether I'm working. They're specifically requesting that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This seems like a simple query asking for confirmation that I'm operational and can provide assistance.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and how they work, as well as some information about responding to greetings like "how are you?" but nothing directly relevant to this specific query. There's also one result about scam text messages that start with "hi, how are you?" but that doesn't seem relevant here either.

Since the search results don't contain information that directly answers this query, I should respond using my existing knowledge. The user is asking for a simple confirmation that I'm working and can respond, and they've specifically requested I say "Yes" if I can respond.

I should follow the user's instruction and respond with "Yes" since I can indeed respond. I should also be helpful and acknowledge that I'm ready to assist them.

I need to avoid starting with a header, avoid using phrases like "based on the search results," and follow the formatting guidelines. Since this is a simple greeting/confirmation request, I don't need extensive formatting or citations.
