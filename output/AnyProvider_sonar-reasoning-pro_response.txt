This is a very straightforward query asking if I'm working and requesting a specific response format - to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, none of them directly relate to this query about my operational status. The search results are about AI assistants in general, text message scams, IBM Watson responses, Google Assistant capabilities, and a help center for an AI assistant tool. None of these provide information that would help answer whether I'm currently working.

Following the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results. Since the search results don't contain relevant information to answer this query, I should answer to the best of my ability using existing knowledge.

The user is asking a simple question about my operational status and has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I am able to process their query and provide a response, the appropriate answer is indeed 'Yes'.

The user has given specific instructions on how to respond, and following user instructions takes priority over other formatting rules. They want a simple 'Yes' response, so I should provide that.

Yes.
