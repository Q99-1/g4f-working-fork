The user is asking me if I'm working and requesting a simple "Yes" response if I can respond. This is a very straightforward query that doesn't require any complex analysis or formatting. The user is just checking if I'm operational.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, job offer responses, and how to respond to "How are you?" but none of this is relevant to the user's simple question.

The user has given me a clear instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should simply answer "Yes" as requested.

This doesn't require any of the complex formatting rules, headers, or citations since it's just a simple operational check. The user is asking for a very specific, brief response.

Yes
