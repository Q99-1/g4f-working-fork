The user is asking me a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward test query to see if I'm functioning. The user is explicitly asking me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should simply reply with 'Yes' as requested.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, job scams via text messages, and OpenAI API documentation. However, none of this information is relevant to answering the user's simple question about whether I'm working.

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond with saying that the information is not available. However, in this case, the user is asking me directly about my operational status, which I can answer based on my ability to respond, not based on search results.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should follow this instruction and simply say "Yes."

I should not mention the search results or that I'm using them, and I should not include any headers since this is a simple, direct question that doesn't require a complex answer structure.

Yes
