This is a simple query asking if I'm working and requesting I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. The user is essentially testing if I'm functioning and asking for a specific response format.

Let me analyze this:
1. The user is asking if I'm working
2. They want me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond
3. This is a straightforward functionality test

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and how they work, job offer responses, and some technical information about Teams AI Assistant, but none of this is directly relevant to answering whether I'm working or not.

Since the user is asking me directly if I'm working and requesting a specific response, and I can clearly respond to their query, I should follow their instruction and reply with "Yes" as requested.

The restrictions say I should not start with a header, and this is a simple query that doesn't need complex formatting. I should just give a direct, concise response
