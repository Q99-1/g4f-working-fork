The user is asking me a simple question: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

This is a straightforward query asking me to confirm that I'm operational and can respond. The user specifically requests that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants, how to respond to various queries, email responses, etc. But this query is very simple and direct - the user just wants me to confirm I'm working by saying "Yes."

The search results don't really provide relevant information for this specific query. The user is just testing if I'm operational and has given me a specific instruction on how to respond.

According to the restrictions, I should not mention that I'm using search results, and if the search results don't provide an answer, I should respond based on my knowledge. In this case, the search results aren't relevant to answering this simple operational check.

The user has given me a clear instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Since I can respond, I should simply say "Yes" as requested.

I should not use any headers since this is a very simple response, and I should follow the user's specific instruction to reply with "Yes."
