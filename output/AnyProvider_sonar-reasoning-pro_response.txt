The user is asking a very simple query: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." They want me to simply reply with "Yes" if I can respond.

Looking at the search results provided, they contain various information about AI assistants, how to respond to "how are you" questions, adding AI assistant responses, job scam warnings, and using AI assistant tools. However, none of this information is relevant to the simple question being asked.

The user is essentially testing if I'm functional and asking for a simple "Yes" response if I can respond. Since I can respond, I should reply with "Yes" as requested.

Looking at the restrictions and guidelines:
- I should not mention that I'm using search results 
- I should answer directly
- The search results are not relevant to this query, so I should answer using my existing knowledge
- The user specifically requested a simple "Yes" response
