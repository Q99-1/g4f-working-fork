The user is asking a simple question about whether I'm working and can respond. They specifically requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a very straightforward query that doesn't require me to use any of the search results provided. 

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. What AI assistants are and how they work
2. How to respond to recruiter emails
3. More information about AI assistants
4. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversation
5. Using an AI Assistant feature in some platform

None of this information is relevant to the user's simple question about whether I'm working and can respond.

According to the restrictions, if the search results do not provide an answer, I should respond saying that the information is not available. However, this is a case where the user is asking me directly if I can respond, which is something I can answer from my basic functionality without needing search results.

The user has given me a specific instruction: "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Following user instructions takes priority over other formatting rules as mentioned in point 8 of the guidelines. Since I can indeed respond, and the user has explicitly requested a "Yes" response, I should follow their instruction.

This is not a complex query that requires headers or detailed analysis. It's a simple functional check that requires a direct response.

Yes
