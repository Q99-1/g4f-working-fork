This is a simple query asking if I'm working/functioning and requesting a specific response format - to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. The user is essentially testing if I'm operational.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants, how they work, and some communication examples, but none of this is directly relevant to answering the simple question "are you working?"

The user has specifically requested that I reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Since I can clearly respond (I'm processing their query and can generate a response), the appropriate answer is simply "Yes" as requested.

This doesn't require any complex analysis or use of the search results. The search results are about AI assistants in general and communication strategies, but the query is just a basic operational check.

I should follow the user's instruction to reply with "Yes" since I can respond, and I don't need to cite any search results since they're not relevant to this simple operational query.

Yes
