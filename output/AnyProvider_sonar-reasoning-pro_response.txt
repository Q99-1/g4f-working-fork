The user is asking a simple question to check if I'm working/operational. They specifically request that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward query asking about my operational status.

The search results provided don't really relate to this query at all - they're about AI assistant capabilities, how AI assistants work, job scams, and how to respond to "how are you" which is different from what's being asked.

Since the search results aren't relevant to the specific query, I should answer based on my existing knowledge. The user is simply asking if I'm working and wants a 'Yes' if I can respond.

I should follow their instruction and respond with 'Yes' since I am indeed able to respond to their query. This is a simple operational check.

I need to be careful about the restrictions - I shouldn't mention that I'm using search results since they're not relevant anyway, and I should answer directly without unnecessary hedging language.

Yes
