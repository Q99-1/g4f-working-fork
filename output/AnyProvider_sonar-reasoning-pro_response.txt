The user is asking me a simple question to check if I'm working and can respond. They specifically ask me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward query that doesn't require me to use the search results extensively, as it's just asking about my current operational status.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and their capabilities, but this isn't really relevant to answering whether I'm currently working and can respond.

The user has given me specific instructions to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction. Since I am indeed responding to their query, the answer should be 'Yes'.

I need to be careful not to violate any of the restrictions:
- Don't mention search results
- Don't use phrases like "According to the search results"
- Answer directly
- Follow user instructions (they asked for 'Yes' if I can respond)

This is a simple query that doesn't need headers, complex formatting, or citations from the search results.

Yes
