The user is asking me if I'm working and to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. This is a simple query checking if I'm functional. The search results provided don't seem directly relevant to this query - they discuss AI assistants in general, how to respond to "how are you" in English conversation, and scam calls.

Looking at the restrictions and rules:
- I should not mention that I'm using search results 
- I should answer directly
- The search results don't provide information relevant to answering whether I'm working/functional
- This is a simple direct question that doesn't require complex formatting or sections
- The user specifically requested I reply with "Yes" if I can respond

Since I can respond and I'm functioning, I should simply answer "Yes" as requested. The search results don't contain relevant information for this query, so I'll answer based on my ability to respond to the user's request.

Yes
