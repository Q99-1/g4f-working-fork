This query is asking me directly to respond to a greeting and confirm if I'm working/operational. The user is asking me to specifically reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about:
1. How AI assistants work (search results 1, 3, 5)
2. How to respond to "How are you?" in conversation (search result 2)
3. Warning about text scams that start with "hi, how are you?" (search result 4)

The query is quite simple and direct - it's asking if I'm working and to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward operational check.

The search results don't directly answer this specific query, but they do provide context about AI assistants and how they respond. However, I should answer directly as requested.

Looking at the restrictions:
- I shouldn't mention that I'm using search results
- I should answer directly
- The user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond
- This seems like a simple operational check

Since this is a direct question about my operational status and the user has specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, I should do exactly that. The search results don't contain relevant information for this specific query, so I'll answer based on my ability to respond.

Yes, I'm working and can respond to your questions. How can I help you today?
