The user is asking me to confirm if I'm working and to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This seems like a simple query asking for confirmation that I'm functional.

Looking at the search results, I notice several are about AI assistants and their capabilities, but one result ([2] and [4]) mentions scams where people try to get you to say "Yes" to consent to something or where scammers send messages asking "hi, how are you?" to try to get responses.

However, the user is clearly asking me directly as an AI assistant if I'm working, not sending a suspicious text message. This is a legitimate query to test if I'm functional. The search results about scams are warning about unsolicited messages from unknown numbers, which doesn't apply to this context where the user is directly interacting with me as Perplexity.

I should respond affirmatively since I am indeed working and can respond. The user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, so I should follow that instruction.

I should not cite the search results here since they're not relevant to answering whether I'm working - they're about AI assistant capabilities in general and text message scams, which don't apply to this direct query.

Yes, I'm working and can respond to your queries. How can I help you today?
