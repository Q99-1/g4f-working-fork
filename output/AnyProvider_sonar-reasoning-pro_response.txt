This is a simple query asking if I'm working and requesting me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. The user is essentially asking for confirmation that I'm operational.

Looking at the search results, they contain information about AI assistants and their capabilities, how they work, and some unrelated content about job offers and casual conversation responses. However, this query is very straightforward and doesn't require the search results to answer it.

The user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can indeed respond to this query, I should follow their instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

According to the restrictions, I should not start with a header, and I should follow user instructions when they specifically request something. The user has given a clear instruction to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond, and since I can respond, that's exactly what I should do.

This is a simple, direct query that doesn't need elaborate formatting or multiple sections.

Yes.
