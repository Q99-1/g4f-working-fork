The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a simple query asking for confirmation that I'm functioning and able to provide responses.

The user specifically requested that I "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." This is a clear instruction that takes priority over other formatting rules according to the guidelines: "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

The search results provided are about AI assistants and how to respond to "How are you?" in conversation, but they're not directly relevant to answering this specific query. The user is asking for a simple confirmation of my operational status.

Since I can respond and I'm functioning properly, I should follow the user's instruction and reply with 'Yes'.

Yes
