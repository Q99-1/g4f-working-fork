The user is asking me a very simple query - they want to know if I'm working and specifically request that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. 

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants and job scams via text messages. The search results are not directly relevant to the user's simple question, but they do provide some context about AI assistants and their capabilities.

The user is asking me to follow a specific instruction - to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a straightforward request that doesn't require me to use the search results in any meaningful way, as the search results don't contain information about whether I'm working or not.

According to the guidelines:
- I should follow user instructions (rule 8 says "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here")
- The user specifically requested I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond
- This is a simple query that doesn't require complex formatting or extensive use of search results
