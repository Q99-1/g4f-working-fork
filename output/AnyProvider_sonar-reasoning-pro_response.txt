The user is asking me if I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very simple query where they just want confirmation that I'm functioning. They've specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond.

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants and their capabilities, but they're not directly relevant to this simple query. The user is asking for a basic confirmation of my availability/functionality.

According to the restrictions, I should follow user instructions, and the user has specifically requested that I reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. Since I can respond, the appropriate answer is simply 'Yes'.

I don't need to cite any search results for this simple query, and I don't need complex formatting. The user wants a simple confirmation.

Yes
