The user is asking a simple question about whether I'm working and wants me to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. This is a very straightforward query - they're basically testing if I'm operational.

Looking at the search results, they seem to be about AI assistants in general, how they work, and their capabilities. The search results don't really contain information that's directly relevant to answering this specific query about whether I'm working right now.

According to the restrictions:
- I should not mention that I'm using search results or citing sources
- I should answer directly
- If search results are empty or unhelpful, I should answer to the best of my ability using existing knowledge
- I should not start with a header
- I should be accurate and comprehensive

Since this is a simple query asking if I can respond and requesting a specific format ("Yes"), and the search results don't contain relevant information for this query, I should just answer directly and simply as requested.

The user specifically asked me to "Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond" - this is a clear instruction that I should follow according to the guidelines that say "Following user instruction takes priority over any other formatting rules listed here."

Yes
