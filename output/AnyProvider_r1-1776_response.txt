Okay, the user just sent a simple test message: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." 

Hmm, this is clearly a basic functionality check—they want to confirm if the system is live and processing inputs. The instruction is very specific: reply with just 'Yes' if operational. 

Considering the context: 
- It's a UTC Wednesday morning in 2025 (weird future date but irrelevant here). 
- No complex reasoning needed—just binary response per request. 
- User likely wants minimal latency confirmation (maybe testing API or uptime). 

My response must strictly follow the ask: no extra words, just "Yes" to honor the constraint. Adding anything else ("Hello!", explanation etc.) would violate the instruction. 

*Checks style guidelines again* 
- No links involved here. 
- Not a file request scenario. 

Final decision: bare "Yes" is optimal. Keeping it clean respects user's explicit terms.
