Okay, the user sent a greeting asking if I'm working and requested a "Yes" reply if I can respond. This seems like a simple availability check—maybe they're testing if the system is online or verifying responsiveness after downtime.  

Hmm, they specifically asked for just "Yes", so I should stick to that exact word without adding extra text. The guidelines say to avoid links entirely here, and there's no need for explanations since they want minimal output.  

Wait—my role is Perplexity, and the instructions emphasize strict adherence to user requests when they're clear. No need to overthink; they literally said "Reply with 'Yes'".  

*Checks style guidelines again*: Yep, no links, no fluff. Just "Yes". Simple confirmation meets their ask perfectly.  

*Prepares response*: One word. Done.
