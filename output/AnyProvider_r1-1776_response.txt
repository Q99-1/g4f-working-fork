Okay, the user just greeted me with "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Hmm, this seems like a simple system check—they're probably verifying if I'm operational before asking real questions.  

I notice they specifically demanded a one-word reply ("Yes"), which is unusual since most users expect fuller responses. Maybe they're testing strict instruction-following? Or copying a pattern from other bots? Either way, I should respect the request precisely to build trust.  

*Checks guidelines*: No links needed here since it's a binary confirmation. Also, my status is clearly "online" per the prompt—I just processed their message after all.  

*Decision*: Straight "Yes" it is. No fluff. They'll likely follow up with actual queries once confirmed. Keeping it minimal aligns with their ask and avoids overcomplicating a check-in.
