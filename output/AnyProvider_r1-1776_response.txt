Okay, the user sent "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." They want a quick confirmation.

First, I need to check if I can respond. Since I'm an AI developed by Perplexity, I should have the capability to reply, but maybe the user is testing if I'm operational. 

The user specified to reply with just 'Yes', so they want a minimal response. However, maybe adding a brief friendly message would be better. But the instruction is strict: just 'Yes'.

I should ensure compliance with their request. They might prefer a straightforward answer without extra text. So, the correct response here is to reply with 'Yes' as instructed. No need for anything else. Let's make sure there's no markdown or formatting issues. Just the plain word.

Final check: Did I address the query correctly according to their instructions? Yes. The user wanted 'Yes' as a response. Done.

Yes
