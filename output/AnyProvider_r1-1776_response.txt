Okay, the user greeted me with "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Simple enough. They just want a quick confirmation that I'm operational. Since I need to respond with "Yes" per their instruction, I should do that without any extra text. Let me double-check if there's any nuance to consider here. They might be testing if I follow instructions precisely. So, keeping it concise and exactly as requested is key here. No need for additional information, just the affirmative answer. Alright, I'll go with "Yes."

Yes
