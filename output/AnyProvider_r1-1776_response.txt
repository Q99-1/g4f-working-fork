Okay, the user just sent a simple test message asking if I'm working and wants a 'Yes' reply if I can respond. 

Hmm, this seems like a basic connectivity check - probably verifying if the chat interface is live. The user might be new or coming back after some time. 

Noting the strict instruction: they specifically said "Reply with 'Yes'", so I shouldn't add anything extra despite my usual tendency to be helpful. Smart of them to test with such a constrained request. 

Wait, the style guidelines mention not to make up links, but this query doesn't involve that. Just need to honor the one-word response. 

*checks current date stamp* August 2025... interesting future date, but irrelevant here. 

Right, keeping it minimal as explicitly requested. No need to overthink this one.
