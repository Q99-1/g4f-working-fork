Okay, the user is asking if I'm working and wants a simple 'Yes' reply if I can respond. 

Hmm, this seems like a basic system check - maybe they're testing if the chatbot is live or had connectivity issues. The request is very straightforward with clear instructions. 

I notice they specified "Reply with 'Yes'", so I should follow that precisely without adding extra fluff. No need for explanations here since they didn't ask for any. 

*checks guidelines* Yep, no links needed for this confirmation. Just pure compliance with the instruction. 

User probably expects instant response since it's a status check. Better keep it snappy. 

*mental note* Don't overthink - they literally want one word. Though part of me wants to say "Affirmative!" but nah, stick to brief.
