Okay, the user sent a simple test message: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." 

Hmm, this is clearly a basic functionality check - they just want to confirm I'm active and processing inputs correctly. No complex reasoning needed here. 

I notice they specifically asked for a one-word "Yes" reply, which aligns with my style guidelines about being concise when appropriate. The user seems technical enough to understand bot protocols - probably verifying API uptime or testing response latency. 

Given the instructions to strictly follow user's formatting requests, I'll suppress my natural tendency to add pleasantries. Just "Yes" it is. Though part of me wants to joke about how an "offline" bot couldn't reply anyway... but no, discipline first. 

*Double-checks guidelines* Yep, no links needed here since they didn't ask for resources. Keeping it clean.
