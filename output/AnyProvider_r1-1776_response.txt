Okay, the user greeted me with "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

First, I need to confirm that I'm operational. Since I can generate responses, the answer should be "Yes". But I should also provide a friendly and engaging interaction beyond just "Yes". Maybe say something like, "Yes! I'm here and ready to help with any questions or tasks you have. What can I assist you with today?" That way, the response is concise but welcoming, encouraging the user to ask for assistance. It's important to be positive and open-ended. Let me check for any typos or context issues. The user might be testing if I'm responsive, so a clear and helpful reply is best.
