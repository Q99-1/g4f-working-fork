Okay, the user sent a message saying "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Let me think about how to handle this.

First, I need to follow the instructions. The user specifically asks to reply with 'Yes' if I can respond. They're checking if the model is operational. My job here is to confirm functionality without adding extra info unless needed.

Looking at the style guidelines: prefer not to generate links, and if asked for a file I can't access, say so instead of making up links. But this query doesn't involve links or filesâ€”it's a simple status check.

Current date is given as August 15, 2025, but that's probably just context. The user's message is straightforward. They want a 'Yes' response if I'm working. Since I'm active and processing their query, the correct reply is indeed 'Yes'.

I should avoid overcomplicating it. No need for explanations or additional text
