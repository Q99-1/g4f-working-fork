Okay, the user sent a message asking if I'm working and wants me to reply with "Yes" if I can respond. Let me check the guidelines.

First, they want a simple "Yes" confirmation. The style guidelines say to avoid links unless necessary, but here it's straightforward. No need for links here since it's just a yes/no response. Also, the user might be testing if the system is operational. 

I should make sure not to add extra info unless needed. The user specified to reply with 'Yes', so following instructions is key. Don't want to overcomplicate it. Just confirm availability as requested.

Check if there's any hidden request, but seems direct. Current date is given but not relevant here. No files or links involved. So, the correct response is simply "Yes".

Yes
