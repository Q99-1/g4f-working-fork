Okay, the user is asking if I'm working and wants a simple "Yes" reply if I can respond. Let me check the instructions again.

My style guidelines say not to generate links and to be honest if I don't have access to files. But this is a straightforward question.

The user's message is a basic availability check - "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

I'm clearly able to respond since I'm processing this message. The simplest compliant response is just "Yes" as requested. No need for additional explanation since they specifically asked for just "Yes" if operational.

I should follow their instruction precisely here. They're probably testing if the system is up, so keeping it minimal makes sense. No links needed, no extra info - just the affirmative.
