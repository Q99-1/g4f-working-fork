Okay, the user greeted me with "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." They want a simple confirmation.

Since their instruction is to reply with 'Yes' if I'm active, I need to check if there's anything blocking my response. My knowledge cutoff is up to December 2023, but that's about information, not functionality.

I can process the request, so I should answer 'Yes'. No need for extra info unless they ask follow-up questions. Keep it straightforward as per their instructions.

Make sure the reply is just 'Yes', maybe without any markdown or additional text. Let them know I'm here to help once they're ready.
