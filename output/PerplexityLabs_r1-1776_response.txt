Okay, the user is asking if I'm working and wants a simple "Yes" reply if I can respond. 

Hmm, this seems like a basic functionality check—maybe they've had issues with other services timing out or disconnecting. The request is very straightforward: no extra analysis needed, just confirm availability. 

Given the strict instruction to only say "Yes" when operational, I shouldn't overcomplicate it. No links, no fluff—just the bare confirmation they asked for. 

...Though part of me wants to add "How can I help?" but they explicitly said *only* "Yes" if functional. Gotta follow instructions precisely here. 

*Double-checks guidelines*: Yep, no deviations allowed for this query. Simple is best.
