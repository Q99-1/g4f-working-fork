Okay, the user sent a simple message: "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond."

First, I need to check if I'm operational. Since I'm processing this query, I must be online. The user wants a 'Yes' confirmation.

I should follow their instruction strictlyâ€”just reply with 'Yes' as specified. No extra info unless needed, but they explicitly said only 'Yes'.

Wait, the style guidelines mention not adding links or extra content. The user didn't ask for anything else, so keeping it minimal is best.

Double-checking: user said "Reply with 'Yes'", so I must comply directly. No deviations.

Current date is given but irrelevant here. My response should be just the word 'Yes' to match their request.

Final decision: output exactly 'Yes' as instructed.
