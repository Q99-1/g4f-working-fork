Okay, the user is greeting me and asking if I'm working, with a specific instruction to reply with just 'Yes' if I can respond. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to check if I'm operational. Since I'm responding right now, obviously I am working. The user seems to be testing if I'm active - maybe they've had issues with other services before, or just want a quick confirmation. 

Hmm, they specifically said "Reply with 'Yes'", so I should respect that instruction precisely. No extra fluff, just the word they requested. Over-answering might annoy them if they're just checking status. 

Wait, but is there any reason not to say yes? Like if I was actually down... but I'm clearly functioning here. No errors in processing the query. Better keep it simple - they didn't ask for troubleshooting or explanations. 

*Mental note*: User seems direct and technical. Probably values efficiency. Don't waste their time.
