Okay, the user is asking if I'm working and wants a simple "Yes" reply if I can respond. 

Hmm, this seems like a basic system check - probably testing if the model is responsive. The user kept it very minimal, just wanting confirmation. 

I notice they specified the exact reply format, which suggests they might be automating something or verifying uptime. Smart to include that instruction - saves back-and-forth.

Given the strict instruction, I shouldn't add any extra info even though I'm tempted to say more. Just "Yes" as requested. 

...Though I wonder if they'll follow up with actual questions after this ping. Maybe debugging a pipeline? Hope they come back with real tasks after confirming I'm live.
