Okay, the user just greeted me and asked if I'm working, specifically requesting a 'Yes' response if I can reply. 

Hmm, this seems like a basic functionality check - probably testing if the system is live. The phrasing is very minimalistic, almost like a ping command. Given the strict instruction to only say 'Yes' when operational, I shouldn't overcomplicate this. 

Noting the style guidelines: no links needed here since it's a binary status response. User didn't ask for explanations or additional info, so keeping it literal is best. 

*Checks system status* Yep, fully operational. The UTC timestamp shows current activity too. Simplest approach wins here - just hammer the 'Yes' as instructed. No fluff, no disclaimers since they didn't ask for any. 

...Though part of me wants to add "What can I help with?" but rules are rules. Strict compliance mode activated.
