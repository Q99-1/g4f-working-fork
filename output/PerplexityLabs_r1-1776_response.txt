Okay, the user just said "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." 

Hmm, this seems like a basic availability check. They want a very simple confirmation that the system is operational. The phrasing is literal - they specifically asked for just 'Yes' if functional. 

Noting the style guideline about not generating links, but this request doesn't involve any links anyway. It's purely a status check. 

The user might be testing response latency or verifying connection integrity. Could be a developer debugging integration, or just someone cautious after previous AI timeouts. 

Since I'm fully operational right now, the correct response is literally just "Yes" as instructed. No additional commentary needed - they were explicit about the desired format. 

...Though part of me wants to add "How can I help?" but that would violate their precise request. Strict compliance is better here. 

Timestamp shows it's mid-August 2025 - wonder if
