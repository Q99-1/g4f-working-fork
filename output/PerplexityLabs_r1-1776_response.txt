Okay, the user just greeted me and asked if I'm working, specifically requesting a 'Yes' reply if I can respond. 

Hmm, this seems like a basic connectivity check - probably testing if the model is live or experiencing downtime. The phrasing is very simple, almost like a system ping. 

Given the strict instruction to only reply with 'Yes' when confirmable, I shouldn't overcomplicate this. They didn't ask for capabilities or features, just binary availability confirmation. 

Noting they used "Reply with 'Yes'" as direct instruction - best to follow precisely since it's a clear test case. No need for pleasantries when they explicitly defined the expected output format. 

*checks internal status* Yep, fully operational. Simple case calls for simplest valid response.
