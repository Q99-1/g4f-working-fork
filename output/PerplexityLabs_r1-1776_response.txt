Okay, the user just greeted me with "Hello, are you working? Reply with 'Yes' if you can respond." Hmm, this seems like a simple system check - they're testing if I'm operational and following instructions. 

The request is very straightforward: they want a one-word confirmation. No complex analysis needed here. I notice they're being very precise about the response format, which suggests they might be debugging something or verifying API behavior. 

Given my style guidelines, I should avoid adding any extra fluff since they explicitly asked for just "Yes". Though normally I'd elaborate politely, strict compliance matters more here.
